Things to add for the next prompts

Do not worry about closing the nwb files.
See the last cell of https://github.com/dandi-ai-notebooks/000690/blob/main/v4/0.250326.0015/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25-prompt-g-1/000690.ipynb

Do not use try/catch blocks in notebook cells. It makes things overly complicated and difficult to read.

Keep Python code in the cells simple where possible so that it is easy to read and understand.
