Based on the above, please provide a qualification grading for the above notebook. This will determine whether the notebook will be eligible to be used as an introductory notebook to the dandiset.

You will respond with a series of XML blocks of the form

<grade>
<question_id>ID</question_id>
<thinking>Your rationale for the grade</thinking>
<grade>PASS|FAIL</grade>
</grade>

where ID is the ID of the question (e.g., dandiset-description, dandiset-metadata, ...), and the grade determines whether the notebook passes or fails based on that criteria.

Do not include any other text in your response. Just the XML blocks.

Note: Warnings in the output cells should not be considered to be problems unless they relate to other problems with the notebook.
