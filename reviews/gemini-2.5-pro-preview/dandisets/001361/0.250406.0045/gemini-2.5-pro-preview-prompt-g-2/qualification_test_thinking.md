The notebook will be evaluated against the ten criteria provided:

1.  **Dandiset Description:** The notebook includes a section "Overview of the Dandiset" which describes Dandiset 001361, its publication, key measurements, and techniques. This criterion is met.

2.  **DANDI API for Metadata and File Listing:** The section "Loading the Dandiset with DANDI API" demonstrates using `DandiAPIClient` to fetch Dandiset metadata (name, URL, DOI, description) and lists the first 5 assets. This criterion is met.

3.  **NWB File Metadata Access:** After loading an NWB file, the notebook prints several metadata attributes like `nwbfile.identifier`, `nwbfile.session_description`, `nwbfile.session_start_time`, etc. The "NWB File Contents Summary" markdown cell also provides a comprehensive overview of typical NWB structure. This criterion is met.

4.  **NWB Data Visualization:** The notebook visualizes multiple data types:
    *   Mouse position (behavioral).
    *   Mean and Maximum intensity projection images (ophys).
    *   ROI masks overlaid on the mean image (ophys).
    *   Fluorescence traces (ophys).
    This criterion is met.

5.  **Plot Issues:** Based on the previous image descriptions:
    *   **Mouse Position Over Time:** No major issues. The plot is clear, well-labeled, and represents the data appropriately, contributing to understanding the animal's behavior.
    *   **Mean Intensity Projection Image:** No major issues. The image is typical for a mean projection and helps visualize the FOV.
    *   **Maximum Intensity Projection Image:** No major issues. Clearly shows cell-like structures, aiding in understanding the FOV.
    *   **All ROI Masks Superimposed on Mean Image:** No major issues. Effectively shows the spatial location of ROIs.
    *   **Fluorescence Traces for First 5 ROIs:** No major issues. The plot visualizes neural activity, and potential artifacts are appropriately noted in the text.
    All plots are interpretable, visualize actual data from the NWB file, and contribute to the reader's understanding. This criterion is met.

6.  **Unsupported Interpretations/Conclusions:** The notebook makes descriptive observations (e.g., "repetitive pattern, likely corresponding to laps") and suggests potential future analyses. It does not draw major conclusions that are unsupported by the visualized data. For example, it notes potential artifacts in fluorescence traces. This criterion is met.

7.  **Output Cells Present:** All code cells have their corresponding output cells (text or images). The notebook appears to have been executed successfully from start to finish, including the final cleanup cell. This criterion is met.

8.  **No Fake/Simulated Data:** The notebook explicitly loads data from the DANDI archive and the specified NWB file. All visualizations are derived from this real dataset. This criterion is met.

9.  **No Major Execution Errors:** There's a `UserWarning` during NWB loading related to namespace caching, which is minor and common, and does not prevent the notebook from functioning correctly. No other errors are observed. This criterion is met.

10. **Other Major Problems:** The notebook is well-structured, provides good explanations, and serves as a solid introduction. The code for loading and visualizing is appropriate. The inclusion of a Neurosift link and a cleanup cell are good practices. There are no other apparent major problems.

All criteria for a PASS grade are met.
