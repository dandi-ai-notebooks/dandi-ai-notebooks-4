The notebook is being evaluated against 10 criteria for suitability as an introductory notebook for the Dandiset.

1.  **Dandiset Description**: PASS. The notebook provides a good overview of Dandiset 000690.
2.  **DANDI API for Dandiset Metadata &amp; File Listing**: PASS. The notebook correctly demonstrates using `DandiAPIClient` to get Dandiset metadata and list assets.
3.  **NWB File Metadata Access**: PASS. The notebook shows how to load an NWB file and access its basic metadata.
4.  **NWB File Data Visualization**: PASS. The notebook visualizes eye tracking, blink, and running wheel data from the NWB file.
5.  **Plot Issues**: FAIL.
    *   Figure 1 (Pupil Area): Minor issues (potential artifacts are visible, but this is raw data). Not a major issue in itself.
    *   Figure 2 (Pupil Position): Minor issues (similar to pupil area, shows raw data with noise/events). Not a major issue.
    *   Figure 3 (Likely Blink): PASS. No major issues.
    *   Figure 4 (Running Speed): MAJOR ISSUE. The plot is titled "Subset of Running Speed over Time" and the y-axis is "Running Speed (cm/s)". However, the data clearly shows negative values. Speed, by definition, is a scalar quantity and cannot be negative. If these values represent velocity (which includes direction), the plot should be labeled accordingly (e.g., "Running Velocity"). Presenting this as "speed" is misleading and confusing, especially for an introductory notebook. This qualifies as a "serious mistake in the plot" or "poor formatting leading to uninterpretable displays" of speed. While the plot shows activity, the mislabeling of this fundamental physical quantity is a major issue for an introductory notebook clarity.
6.  **Interpretations/Conclusions**: PASS. The notebook makes modest claims and accurately summarizes what was demonstrated.
7.  **Output Cells Present**: PASS. All code cells have outputs.
8.  **No Fake/Simulated Data**: PASS. All data is loaded from the Dandiset.
9.  **No Major Execution Errors**: PASS. There is a minor error messages related to `DynamicTable.to_dataframe` unsupported `columns` argument for subsetting, but the notebook handles it with a `try-except` and still provides other ways to inspect the units table. This is not a major error that stops the notebook or prevents key understanding. Warnings about HDMF namespace versions are also minor.
10. **No Other Major Problems**: The main problem is the one identified in criterion 5.

Because Figure 4 (Running Speed) has a major issue (negative values for "speed" without proper labeling as velocity or explanation), the notebook fails criterion 5. This is a significant problem for an introductory notebook, as it can cause confusion about fundamental data properties.
