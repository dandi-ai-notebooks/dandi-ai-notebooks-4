The notebook is being evaluated against ten criteria to determine its suitability as an introductory notebook for Dandiset 000690.

1.  **Dandiset Description:** The notebook includes a comprehensive description of the Dandiset, its purpose, keywords, and citation. (PASS)
2.  **DANDI API for Metadata and File Listing:** The notebook demonstrates using `DandiAPIClient` to fetch Dandiset metadata (name, URL, description) and lists the first few assets (files) with their paths and IDs. (PASS)
3.  **NWB File Metadata Access:** After loading an NWB file, the notebook shows how to access and print key metadata fields such as session description, identifier, session start time, institution, and subject details (ID, species, sex, age). (PASS)
4.  **Visualization of NWB Data:** The notebook successfully loads data from the selected NWB file and visualizes:
    *   Running speed over time.
    *   Timings of specific stimulus presentations.
    *   A spike raster plot for a subset of neural units. (PASS)
5.  **Plot Issues:**
    *   **Running Speed Plot:** The plot itself is technically correct in displaying the data loaded. The data includes negative values for running speed. While an explanation for these negative values would enhance understanding, its absence is not a "major issue" with the *plot itself* according to the provided definitions (e.g., it's not missing data, all zeros, uninterpretable due to formatting, or a serious mistake in plotting the available data). The plot accurately reflects the data from the NWB file.
    *   **Stimulus Presentation Plot:** This plot is clear. There's a minor discrepancy between the code/plot title (showing 20 intervals) and the subsequent markdown description (mentioning 100 intervals), which is a textual error but not a plot issue.
    *   **Spike Raster Plot:** This plot is clear and effectively visualizes spike times.
    No plot exhibits missing data, all zeros data that makes it uninformative, poor formatting leading to uninterpretability, or serious mistakes in depiction. (PASS)
6.  **Unsupported Interpretations/Conclusions:** The notebook largely focuses on demonstrating data access and visualization. Interpretive statements are general (e.g., "Variations in speed can be correlated...") or refer to potential future analyses. It avoids making specific conclusions not directly supported by the visualizations. The careful omission of the noisy eye-tracking data visualization, with explanation, supports this. (PASS)
7.  **Output Cell Presence:** All code cells that should produce output (text or figures) have corresponding output cells, indicating successful execution. (PASS)
8.  **No Fake/Simulated Data:** All data presented and visualized is loaded directly from the DANDI archive and the specified NWB file. No simulated data is used. (PASS)
9.  **Cell Execution Errors:** The notebook executes successfully. Warnings related to HDMF namespace caching are present but are noted as acceptable and do not impede the core functionality or understanding for an introductory purpose. (PASS)
10. **Other Major Problems:**
    *   The notebook is well-structured and provides clear guidance.
    *   The choice of NWB file (non-ecephys for simplicity) is justified.
    *   The summary of NWB file_contents is helpful.
    *   The issue of negative running speed, while un-commented upon, showcases real data an experimenter might encounter. It does not prevent the notebook from serving its introductory purpose of demonstrating *how* to access and see the data.
    There are no other major problems that would prevent its use as an introductory notebook. (PASS)

All criteria are met without major issues.
