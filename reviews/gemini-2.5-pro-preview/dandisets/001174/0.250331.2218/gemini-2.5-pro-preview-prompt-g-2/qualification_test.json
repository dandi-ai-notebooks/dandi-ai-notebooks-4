    "image_descriptions": "Okay, I will provide a detailed description of each image generated in the notebook.\n\n---\n\n**Figure 1: Raw Imaging Data (OnePhotonSeries) - Frame 3020**\n\n*   **Overview:** This figure displays a single, specific frame (frame number 3020) from the raw one-photon calcium imaging data (`OnePhotonSeries`). The image is presented in grayscale, where pixel intensity corresponds to the fluorescence level recorded by the miniscope. The purpose of this plot is to give the user a visual impression of the raw data before any processing (like motion correction or segmentation) has been applied. One can observe some characteristic features of miniscope imaging, such as vignetting (the field of view is brighter in the center and dimmer towards the edges) and a generally diffuse fluorescence signal. Individual cells are not typically clearly discernible in such raw frames without further processing, though some brighter, localized spots might hint at their presence.\n*   **Minor Issues:**\n    *   No significant minor issues. The title is informative, specifying the data source and frame number.\n    *   Axes are labeled \"X pixel\" and \"Y pixel,\" which is appropriate.\n    *   The colorbar is labeled \"Intensity (fluorescence),\" clearly indicating the displayed values and their units.\n    *   The contrast, adjusted by clipping to 1st and 99th percentiles, seems reasonable for visualizing features in the raw data.\n    *   The aspect ratio appears correct for the data dimensions (320 height, 200 width).\n*   **Major Issues:**\n    *   No major issues. The image successfully shows what it's intended to: a sample raw imaging frame.\n\n---\n\n**Figure 2: Fluorescence Traces for First 3 ROIs**\n\n*   **Overview:** This figure plots the fluorescence intensity over time for the first three Regions of Interest (ROIs) identified in the NWB file (labeled ROI 0, ROI 1, and ROI 2). The x-axis represents time in seconds, spanning the duration of the recording (~600 seconds). The y-axis represents the fluorescence signal, with units of \"fluorescence.\" Each colored line corresponds to the activity trace of a single ROI. The plot shows distinct patterns of activity: ROI 0 (blue) exhibits prominent, large-amplitude fluctuations (calcium transients), suggesting strong and frequent neural activity. ROI 1 (orange) and ROI 2 (green) show much lower amplitude fluctuations, indicating less pronounced or less frequent activity compared to ROI 0 within this selected time window and for these specific ROIs.\n*   **Minor Issues:**\n    *   No significant minor issues. The title \"Fluorescence Traces for First 3 ROIs\" is clear.\n    *   Axes are labeled \"Time (s)\" and \"Fluorescence (fluorescence).\"\n    *   The legend clearly distinguishes the traces for ROI 0, ROI 1, and ROI 2.\n    *   The seaborn style enhances readability.\n*   **Major Issues:**\n    *   No major issues. The data is plotted clearly and is interpretable as neural activity traces.\n\n---\n\n**Figure 3: Image Mask for ROI 0**\n\n*   **Overview:** This figure displays the spatial footprint (image mask) of ROI 0. The plot is a 2D representation of the imaging field of view, with the x and y axes representing pixel coordinates. The color intensity (using the 'viridis' colormap) at each pixel indicates the weight or contribution of that pixel to ROI 0. A bright, localized area in the upper-left quadrant shows the shape and location of this specific ROI. The surrounding area is dark, indicating those pixels do not belong to ROI 0.\n*   **Minor Issues:**\n    *   No significant minor issues. The title \"Image Mask for ROI 0\" is informative.\n    *   Axes are labeled \"X pixel\" and \"Y pixel.\"\n    *   The colorbar is labeled \"Pixel Weight,\" which is appropriate for an image mask.\n    *   `interpolation='nearest'` ensures the pixelated nature of the mask is preserved, which is good for this type of data.\n*   **Major Issues:**\n    *   No major issues. The mask is clearly visualized.\n\n---\n\n**Figure 4: Image Mask for ROI 1**\n\n*   **Overview:** Similar to Figure 3, this figure displays the spatial footprint for ROI 1. It shows another localized bright region, also in the upper-left quadrant but slightly shifted relative to ROI 0, representing the pixels assigned to ROI 1.\n*   **Minor Issues:**\n    *   No significant minor issues. Consistent and appropriate labeling and presentation as in Figure 3.\n*   **Major Issues:**\n    *   No major issues. The mask is clearly visualized.\n\n---\n\n**Figure 5: Image Mask for ROI 2**\n\n*   **Overview:** This figure displays the spatial footprint for ROI 2. This ROI is located more towards the center-left of the imaging field, distinct from ROIs 0 and 1. Its shape and pixel weights are visualized using the same 'viridis' colormap.\n*   **Minor Issues:**\n    *   No significant minor issues. Consistent and appropriate labeling and presentation.\n*   **Major Issues:**\n    *   No major issues. The mask is clearly visualized.\n\n---\n\n**Figure 6: Superimposed Image Masks for All 40 ROIs (Max Projection)**\n\n*   **Overview:** This figure presents a composite view of all 40 ROI image masks found in the NWB file. It's created by taking a maximum projection, meaning that for each pixel in the imaging field, the highest weight assigned to it across all individual ROI masks is displayed. The 'hot' colormap is used, where brighter/hotter colors indicate higher pixel weights. This visualization provides an overview of the spatial distribution of all identified neurons within the imaged field of view. One can see numerous distinct, cell-like shapes scattered across the area.\n*   **Minor Issues:**\n    *   No significant minor issues. The title \"Superimposed Image Masks for All 40 ROIs (Max Projection)\" clearly describes the content.\n    *   Axes are labeled \"X pixel\" and \"Y pixel.\"\n    *   The colorbar is labeled \"Max Pixel Weight,\" which is suitable for a max projection image of masks.\n*   **Major Issues:**\n    *   No major issues. The plot effectively illustrates the location and general morphology of all detected ROIs.\n\n---",
