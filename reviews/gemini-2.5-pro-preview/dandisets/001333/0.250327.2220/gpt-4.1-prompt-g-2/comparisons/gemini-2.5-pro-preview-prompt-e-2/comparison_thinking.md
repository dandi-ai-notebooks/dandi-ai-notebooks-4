Both notebooks aim to introduce Dandiset 001333. Let's compare them against the specified criteria:

1.  **Title and AI Disclaimer:**
    *   Both notebooks have appropriate titles including the Dandiset name and number.
    *   Both include a clear AI-generated/unverified disclaimer. (Equal)

2.  **Overview of Dandiset & DANDI Link:**
    *   Notebook 1 provides a good overview, explains the data types (Beta ARV, LFP), links to the Dandiset, and mentions the arXiv paper.
    *   Notebook 2 also provides an overview, largely by quoting the Dandiset description directly, and includes the link.
    *   Notebook 1's overview is slightly more synthesized and sets the stage for its LFP analysis. (Slightly better for N1)

3.  **Summary of Notebook Content:**
    *   Notebook 1 clearly lists what the user will do (explore metadata, load/inspect NWB, visualize LFP & spectra, learn about Beta ARV).
    *   Notebook 2 provides a numbered list of tasks (connect to DANDI, list assets, load NWB, inspect metadata, visualize Beta Band Voltage).
    *   Both are clear. Notebook 1 is slightly more descriptive of the *analysis* aspects. (Slightly better for N1)

4.  **List of Required Packages:**
    *   Both list necessary packages. Notebook 2 includes `seaborn` which it uses for plotting. Notebook 1 uses `scipy` for PSD, which is listed. (Equal)

5.  **Loading Dandiset via DANDI API:**
    *   Both notebooks correctly demonstrate using `DandiAPIClient` to fetch Dandiset metadata and list assets. (Equal)

6.  **Loading NWB File and Metadata Inspection:**
    *   Notebook 1 chooses an LFP file (`sub-healthy-simulated-lfp/...`), loads it, and shows session info, subject info, publication, keywords, lab, institution, and a well-formatted electrode table (Pandas DF + custom Markdown).
    *   Notebook 2 chooses a Beta ARV file (`sub-healthy-simulated-beta/...`), loads it, and shows NWB ID, session info, experimenter, publications, keywords, lab, institution, and the electrode table as a Pandas DF.
    *   Both successfully load a file. Notebook 1's presentation of electrode information is slightly more user-friendly with the additional markdown table. (Slightly better for N1)

7.  **Description of Available Data in NWB File:**
    *   Notebook 1 focuses on the LFP data from its chosen file and explicitly mentions an attempt to find Beta ARV (which is not in that specific file), guiding the user.
    *   Notebook 2 focuses on the "Beta_Band_Voltage" (Beta ARV) found in its chosen file. It mentions LFP is in other files in the future directions.
    *   Notebook 1 does a better job of highlighting the two main data types mentioned in the Dandiset description (LFP and Beta ARV) and how one might look for them. (Better for N1)

8.  **Loading and Visualizing Different Data Types:**
    *   Notebook 1 loads the LFP data, plots a time segment, and then calculates and plots its Power Spectral Density (PSD), highlighting the beta band. This is a highly relevant first analysis for this Dandiset. It then shows code to *check* for Beta ARV, explaining why it's not found in the current LFP-focused file.
    *   Notebook 2 loads the "Beta_Band_Voltage" data and plots it as a time series. It does not attempt to look for LFP in its chosen file.
    *   Notebook 1 is superior here. It demonstrates analysis of LFP (a primary signal) and its spectral properties, directly related to the Dandiset's theme. It also educates the user on how to check for other data types. Notebook 2 only shows a time-plot of a derived signal (Beta ARV). (Significantly better for N1)

9.  **Advanced Visualization (More than one piece of data):**
    *   Notebook 1's PSD plot is a derived visualization from the LFP data, which is a common and insightful "next step" visualization.
    *   Notebook 2 only shows a simple time-series plot.
    *   Notebook 1 is better. (Better for N1)

10. **Summary of Findings and Future Directions:**
    *   Notebook 1 summarizes what was done (metadata, LFP plotting, spectra) and offers relevant future directions (compare healthy/parkinsonian, explore Beta ARV, longer signals).
    *   Notebook 2 summarizes the contents of the *specific NWB file* it analyzed and also offers good future directions (comparative analysis, exploring LFP, spectrograms).
    *   Both are good. Notebook 1's summary relates more to the notebook's actions. (Equal)

11. **Explanatory Markdown Cells:**
    *   Both notebooks have good explanatory markdown. Notebook 1's explanations around LFP, PSD, and the beta band feel slightly more detailed and neuroscientifically contextualized. (Slightly better for N1)

12. **Well-documented Code & Best Practices:**
    *   Notebook 1: Code is clear, uses `remfile`, explicitly subsets data for PSD/plotting due to remote access (good practice), and includes `io.close()` etc. at the end.
    *   Notebook 2: Code is clear, uses `remfile`. It loads all Beta ARV data (noting it's small). It does not explicitly show `io.close()`.
    *   Notebook 1 demonstrates slightly better practices for handling potentially large remote data and resource management. (Slightly better for N1)

13. **Focus on Basics, Not Overanalysis/Overinterpretation:**
    *   Notebook 1: Clearly states its goal is to illustrate access and exploration, not exhaustive analysis. Its interpretation of the PSD (lack of strong beta in healthy sim) is cautious and appropriate.
    *   Notebook 2: The interpretation of the "Beta_Band_Voltage" plot states: "This signal is in the frequency domain representation for the beta band." This is confusing because the ARV is a time-domain signal representing the amplitude/power envelope of the beta-filtered LFP. It's derived *using* frequency information, but the plotted signal is voltage vs. time.
    *   Notebook 1 is significantly better in terms of accurate and cautious interpretation. (Significantly better for N1)

14. **Visualization Clarity:**
    *   Notebook 1: LFP time series and PSD plots are clear, well-labeled, and the PSD with beta band emphasis is very informative.
    *   Notebook 2: The Beta Band Voltage plot is clear, but the y-axis starts from 0, which might be slightly unconventional for a voltage signal that could be bipolar (though ARV is rectified, its baseline isn't necessarily hard zero). The main issue is the interpretation mentioned above.
    *   Notebook 1's visualizations are more insightful and correctly interpreted. (Better for N1)

**Guiding Questions Synthesis:**
*   **Understanding Dandiset Purpose/Content:** N1 edges out N2 by better connecting its LFP/PSD analysis to the core theme of Parkinson's and beta oscillations.
*   **Confidence in Accessing Data:** N1 is much better, showing how to get LFP and how to *check* for Beta ARV, versus N2 just showing Beta ARV access.
*   **NWB Structure Understanding:** N1 provides a slightly better example by showing access to `ElectricalSeries` within a `LFP` `DataInterface` and trying to find another `DataInterface` (`Beta_ARV`).
*   **Helpfulness of Visualizations:** N1's PSD plot is more analytically helpful for this Dandiset than N2's time-series of Beta ARV.
*   **Misleading Visualizations/Interpretations:** N2 has a misleading interpretation of its Beta ARV plot. N1 is clear.
*   **Overall Helpfulness & Reusability:** N1 provides a more robust starting point, especially for users interested in LFP analysis. Its code for PSD and its approach to checking for data types are more instructive.

**Conclusion:**
Notebook 1 is significantly better. It chooses to analyze LFP data, which is a primary signal type, and performs a relevant spectral analysis (PSD) that directly addresses the Dandiset's focus on beta oscillations. It handles remote data streaming well, educates the user on how to look for different data types within the NWB structure, and its interpretations are accurate and cautious. Notebook 2 focuses on a derived signal (Beta ARV) and contains a misleading interpretation of its visualization. While functional, Notebook 1 offers a more comprehensive, instructive, and neuroscientifically sound introduction to the Dandiset.
