1.  **Dandiset Description:** The notebook starts with a title, link, description, citation, and keywords for Dandiset 001366. This criterion is met.
2.  **DANDI API for Metadata and File Listing:** The first code cell uses `DandiAPIClient` to fetch and print Dandiset metadata (name, URL, description) and lists NWB assets with their paths, IDs, and sizes. This criterion is met.
3.  **NWB File Metadata Access:** A selected NWB file is loaded using `pynwb`, and various metadata attributes (e.g., `session_description`, `identifier`, `session_start_time`, subject details) are printed. This criterion is met.
4.  **NWB Data Visualization:** The notebook visualizes data from the NWB file by:
    *   Displaying selected frames from the `ImageSeries` ("Movies").
    *   Plotting the mean frame intensity over time.
    Both use actual data from the NWB file. This criterion is met.
5.  **Plot Integrity:**
    *   **Example Frames:** The image shows 5 distinct frames. Data is present, not all zeros, formatting is clear, no obvious mistakes, and it helps the reader understand the raw imaging data. No major issues.
    *   **Mean Frame Intensity:** The plot shows a fluctuating signal over time. Data is present, not all zeros, formatting is clear, no obvious mistakes, and it gives an overview of intensity changes. No major issues.
    This criterion is met.
6.  **Supported Interpretations/Conclusions:** The notebook primarily demonstrates access and visualization. The "Summary and Future Directions" suggests reasonable next steps and includes appropriate caveats. No major unsupported interpretations are present. This criterion is met.
7.  **Output Cell Presence:** All code cells designed to produce output (text or images) have corresponding output cells populated with results. The notebook appears to have been fully executed. This criterion is met.
8.  **No Fake/Simulated Data:** Data visualizations (image frames, intensity plot) are derived directly from the NWB file loaded from DANDI. No simulated data is used. This criterion is met.
9.  **No Major Execution Errors:** The notebook execution output shows some `UserWarning`s related to HDMF namespace versions. These are warnings, not errors, and do not impede the loading or analysis of the data. They are acceptable per the instructions. No `Error` or `Exception` tracebacks are present. This criterion is met.
10. **Other Major Problems:**
    *   There is a minor inconsistency: The session description in the manually created markdown table ("NWB File Structure Overview") is slightly different from the one printed directly from the `nwb.session_description` attribute. The code correctly retrieves the actual description from the NWB file, so this is a minor documentation issue in the markdown, not a functional problem with the notebook's core purpose.
    *   The notebook is clear, demonstrates the key introductory steps, and uses appropriate tools. The hardcoded URL for the NWB file is acceptable for an illustrative example.
    No other major problems are identified that would prevent its use as an introductory notebook. This criterion is met.

All criteria for passing are met.
