The notebook meets most of the criteria for a passing introductory notebook.
1.  **Dandiset Description:** The notebook adequately describes the Dandiset.
2.  **DANDI API Usage:** It correctly demonstrates using the DANDI API to access Dandiset metadata and list assets.
3.  **NWB File Metadata:** It successfully shows how to load an NWB file and inspect its metadata (session info, series, subject info).
4.  **NWB Data Visualization:** It includes code to visualize data from an NWB file, and a plot is generated.
5.  **Plot Issues:** This is where the major issue lies.
    *   The plot of "Segment of current_clamp-response-01-ch-0" shows "Potential (volts)" on the y-axis with values around -2300 Volts.
    *   While the notebook states, "The data unit: volts" and "Conversion factor: 3.051757880712104e-05", and correctly notes that "intracellular recordings are typically in the millivolt (mV) range," presenting a membrane potential trace labeled in Volts with such a magnitude is highly problematic for an introductory notebook.
    *   This is physiologically implausible for a direct membrane potential reading in Volts. Such a visualization is likely to confuse a reader, especially one new to electrophysiology or this dataset.
    *   According to the grading criteria: "Even if the plot looks technically correct, if it doesn't contribute to the reader's understanding of the data, then it is a major issue." A plot showing membrane potential measurements in the thousands of Volts does not contribute to a clear understanding; in fact, it likely hinders it or suggests errors in the data or its metadata representation.
    *   While the notebook is likely plotting what `pynwb` provides based on the NWB file's internal metadata (`unit: volts` after applying `conversion`), the result is not a helpful or clear visualization for an introductory purpose. It suggests a problem with the NWB file's scaling/unit conventions that make direct plotting in "Volts" misleading for membrane potential. An introductory notebook should ideally present a clear, interpretable example or guide the user on how to achieve such an interpretation (e.g., further scaling if needed).
6.  **Interpretations/Conclusions:** The notebook does not make major unsupported interpretations.
7.  **Output Cells:** All outputs are present, indicating successful execution.
8.  **Fake Data:** No fake data is used; real data is loaded.
9.  **Execution Errors:** There are no major execution errors.
10. **Other Major Problems:** The primary major problem is the visualization discussed in point 5.

Because the visualization of the electrophysiological data shows physiologically implausible values when labeled in "Volts" (around -2300 V), it fails to provide a clear and understandable example for an introductory user. This is considered a major issue as per criterion 5, as it does not contribute to the reader's understanding of the data in a physiologically relevant way and could cause significant confusion.
