The notebook fulfills many requirements for an introductory guide: it describes the dandiset, demonstrates DANDI API usage for metadata and file listing, and shows how to access NWB file metadata. It also visualizes data from an NWB file, and the code executes with only minor warnings, using actual data from the dandiset. Output cells are present.

However, there is a major issue with the plots (Criterion 5 and subsequently Criterion 6 and 10).
Specifically:
1.  **Figure 1 (Current Clamp Data)**: Displays voltage in "Volts" with a range around -48V to -53V.
2.  **Figure 2 (Voltage Clamp Data)**: Displays current in "Amperes" with transients reaching -2000A.
3.  **Figure 3 (Stimulus and Response)**: Displays voltage in "Volts" (similar to Fig 1) and stimulus current in "Amperes" (around -75A).

While NWB files store data in base SI units (Volts, Amperes), and the plots correctly label these units, the presented magnitudes are drastically different from typical physiological values (which are in millivolts, picoamperes, or nanoamperes). For an *introductory* notebook, showing these raw, unscaled SI unit values without any accompanying explanation or conversion to more conventional physiological scales is highly misleading. A reader new to NWB or this dataset might incorrectly conclude that the data is erroneous, that the experiments are fundamentally different from standard patch-clamp, or simply be confused. This significantly hinders the goal of helping a reader understand the data.

The definition of a major issue in a plot includes: "Even if the plot looks technically correct, if it doesn't contribute to the reader's understanding of the data, then it is a major issue." These plots, without context on SI units vs. typical physiological representations, harm understanding by presenting values that appear physiologically implausible. This lack of context is a serious pedagogical flaw for an introductory notebook.

This also impacts Criterion 6, as interpretations like "neuronal response" or "fast inward current" are made based on data whose presented scale is problematic for direct physiological interpretation without clarification. Finally, this constitutes a "major problem that would prevent it from being used as an introductory notebook" (Criterion 10).

The notebook should include a clear statement that NWB uses SI units and either:
a. Explain that for physiological interpretation, these values would typically be scaled (e.g., multiply Volts by 1000 to get mV, multiply Amperes by 1e9 or 1e12 to get nA or pA).
b. Perform this scaling before plotting for more conventional visualization.

Without such clarification, the notebook is likely to confuse rather than enlighten an introductory audience about the electrophysiological data in this Dandiset.
