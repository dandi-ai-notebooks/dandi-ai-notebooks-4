They both help understand the purpose and content of the Dandiset, demonstrate how to access data, explain NWB file structure, and include good visualizations.\n\nHowever, Notebook 1 is more comprehensive in its exploration of the dataset. It shows a wider range of data access techniques, includes the useful advanced multi-trace visualization, and provides a more thorough overview of the dataset. While Notebook 2 has some strengths in its explanations and formatting, Notebook 1 covers more ground and would likely be more useful for a new user trying to understand and work with this Dandiset.\n\nBased on the criteria, Notebook 1 provides a more comprehensive introduction to the Dandiset and shows more techniques for exploring the data.",
