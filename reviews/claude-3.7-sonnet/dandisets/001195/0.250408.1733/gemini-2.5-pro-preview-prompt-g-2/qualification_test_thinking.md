Let's evaluate this notebook against each criterion:

1. Description of the dandiset: PASS - The notebook includes a clear overview section that describes Dandiset 001195, including its title, related publication, and the types of data it contains.

2. Using DANDI API for metadata: PASS - The notebook demonstrates proper use of the DANDI API (DandiAPIClient) to access metadata and list files from the dandiset.

3. Accessing NWB file metadata: PASS - The notebook successfully loads an NWB file and displays its metadata (identifier, session description, start time, etc.).

4. Visualizing data from an NWB file: PASS - The notebook includes code to visualize intracellular electrophysiology data (current clamp recordings) from the NWB file, with a clear plot showing both stimulus and response.

5. Quality of plots: PASS - The included figure successfully shows neuronal response data with no major issues. The plot is interpretable and effectively demonstrates the intended neurophysiological recording.

6. Supported interpretations: PASS - The interpretations provided (explaining the voltage response, action potentials, etc.) are well supported by the displayed data.

7. Output cells present: PASS - All expected output cells are present, showing the results of code execution.

8. No fake/simulated data: PASS - The notebook loads real data from the dandiset rather than simulating or generating fake data.

9. No major execution errors: PASS - The notebook executes without major errors; all cells complete their execution successfully.

10. No other major problems: PASS - The notebook is well-structured, with explanatory text between code cells, and provides a clear pathway for understanding the dandiset.

While there were minor issues with the plot (missing annotation, scientific notation for y-axis), these aren't significant enough to prevent understanding or to fail the notebook.

Given that all criteria are satisfied, this notebook passes the review.
