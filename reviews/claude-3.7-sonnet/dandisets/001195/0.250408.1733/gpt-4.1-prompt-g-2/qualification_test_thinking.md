Let me evaluate this notebook against each of the criteria:

1. The notebook contains a description of the dandiset: ✅ PASS
   - The first cell provides a comprehensive overview of Dandiset 001195, including title, DOI, description, keywords, access information, contributors, and techniques.

2. The notebook shows how to use the DANDI API to access metadata and list files: ✅ PASS
   - It connects to the DANDI API, retrieves metadata, and lists the first 5 assets in the dandiset.

3. The notebook shows how to access metadata for an NWB file: ✅ PASS
   - It accesses and displays session metadata and subject metadata from a specific NWB file.

4. The notebook shows how to visualize data from an NWB file: ✅ PASS
   - It visualizes current clamp response and stimulus data from the NWB file.

5. The plots have no major issues: ✅ PASS
   - The plot shows real electrophysiological data with a current clamp response and corresponding stimulus.
   - The plot is properly formatted with clear axis labels and titles.
   - The data appears valid and interpretable, showing a typical hyperpolarizing current step and membrane potential response.

6. The notebook has no unsupported major interpretations or conclusions: ✅ PASS
   - The interpretations are simple and directly supported by the data, describing what the plots show without overreaching.

7. Output cells are present where expected: ✅ PASS
   - All code cells have corresponding output cells with appropriate content.

8. The notebook does not generate fake or simulated data: ✅ PASS
   - It loads actual data from the dandiset rather than simulating it.

9. The notebook has no major errors in cell execution: ✅ PASS
   - All cells execute without errors. There are no errors in the output cells.

10. The notebook has no other major problems: ✅ PASS
    - The notebook provides a clear introduction to the dandiset and demonstrates key functionality for exploring the data.
    - It includes useful explanations of the data and provides next steps for researchers.

All criteria are met, so this notebook passes the evaluation.
