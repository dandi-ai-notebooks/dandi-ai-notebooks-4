Both plots display 5 seconds of data, with time on the x-axis and amplitude in volts on the y-axis. The signals appear oscillatory in nature, with similar amplitudes in both subjects (approximately \u00b10.005V). Both signals show rapid fluctuations typical of neural recordings. There are no apparent formatting issues, and the axes are properly labeled. There are no major issues with this visualization.\n\n## Figure 2: Power Spectral Density of LFP\nThis figure displays the power spectral density (PSD) of LFP data on a logarithmic y-scale, comparing healthy (blue) and parkinsonian (orange) subjects. The x-axis shows frequency from 0 to 100 Hz. A prominent peak is visible around 30 Hz, particularly in the parkinsonian subject, which likely corresponds to the beta band activity mentioned in the text. No formatting issues are present, and the axes are well-labeled. One limitation is that only the parkinsonian subject's data appears prominently visible - the healthy subject's line may be underneath or very similar to the parkinsonian data, making the comparison difficult.\n\n## Figure 3: Beta Band Power Comparison\nThis figure focuses specifically on the beta frequency band (13-30 Hz) power comparison between healthy and parkinsonian subjects. The x-axis shows frequency and the y-axis shows PSD values. The lines for both subjects appear to overlap almost perfectly, with a peak around 27-28 Hz. The graph is well-formatted with clear labels. However, the significant overlap between the two lines makes it difficult to distinguish differences between the healthy and parkinsonian conditions in this specific sample, which appears inconsistent with the text's description of expected differences.\n\n## Figure 4: Beta ARV Comparison\nThis time series plot shows Beta Average Rectified Voltage (ARV) data comparing healthy (blue) and parkinsonian (orange) subjects. The x-axis shows time (seconds) and the y-axis shows Beta ARV values in volts. The parkinsonian subject clearly displays higher Beta ARV values throughout the recording period, with values approximately 3-4 times higher than the healthy subject. This visualization effectively demonstrates the expected difference between conditions described in the text. No formatting issues are present.\n\n## Figure 5: Distribution of Beta ARV Values\nThis histogram shows the distribution of Beta ARV values for healthy (blue) and parkinsonian (orange) subjects. The x-axis shows Beta ARV values in volts and the y-axis shows counts. The distributions are clearly separated, with healthy subject values concentrated below 0.0001V and parkinsonian values more broadly distributed between 0.0001V and 0.0004V. This visualization effectively illustrates the statistical difference described in the text. The figure is well-formatted with proper labels.\n\n## Figure 6: Multiple LFP Time Series Comparison\nThis 2\u00d73 grid displays time series plots comparing three healthy sessions (top row) and three parkinsonian sessions (bottom row). Each plot shows amplitude (V) on the y-axis and sample number on the x-axis. All six plots display similar oscillatory patterns with comparable amplitudes, making it difficult to visually distinguish between healthy and parkinsonian conditions from the raw time series alone. The figure is well-formatted with consistent scales across all subplots and proper labeling.\n\n## Figure 7: PSD Comparison Across Sessions\nThis figure shows power spectral density comparisons across sessions, with healthy sessions in the top panel and parkinsonian sessions in the bottom panel. Each line represents a different session. The plots show very similar spectral profiles across all sessions, with major peaks around 30 Hz. The substantial overlap between sessions and between groups makes it difficult to visually distinguish clear differences. The figure is well-formatted with proper logarithmic scaling and labels.\n\n## Figure 8: Beta Band Power Comparison Across Sessions\nThis figure compares beta band (13-30 Hz) power across all sessions, with healthy sessions shown as dashed blue lines and parkinsonian sessions as solid orange lines. All sessions show an increase in power toward the higher end of the beta band (around 27-30 Hz), with a vertical red dotted line marking a \"Typical PD Beta Peak\" at 27 Hz. There's considerable overlap between conditions, though some parkinsonian sessions appear to show slightly different patterns. The figure is well-formatted with a clear legend and proper axis labels.\n\n## Figure 9: Spectrograms Comparison\nThis figure shows spectrograms (time-frequency representations) for a healthy subject (top) and parkinsonian subject (bottom). The x-axis represents time (seconds), the y-axis represents frequency (0-100 Hz), and color represents power (dB/Hz). Both spectrograms show similar patterns of activity across frequencies, with greater power (yellower regions) at certain frequency bands. The spectrograms are well-formatted with color bars, though it's difficult to visually identify clear differences between the conditions. There are no major issues with this visualization.\n\n## Figure 10: Beta Band Focused Spectrograms\nSimilar to Figure 9, but zoomed in to focus on the beta frequency range (10-35 Hz) with red dashed lines marking the beta band boundaries (13-30 Hz). The visualization allows for more detailed examination of beta oscillations in both subjects. No clear differences are immediately apparent between the conditions, consistent with the text's note that spectrogram visualization might not be the most sensitive method for detecting beta differences. The figure is well-formatted with proper frequency range focusing on the relevant band.\n\n## Figure 11: Multiple Spectrograms Comparison\nThis 2\u00d73 grid shows spectrograms for three healthy sessions (top row) and three parkinsonian sessions (bottom row), focused on the 10-35 Hz frequency range. All six spectrograms display similar patterns of activity, with no obvious systematic differences between healthy and parkinsonian conditions visible through this visualization method. The figure is well-formatted with consistent colorbars and frequency ranges across all subplots.\n\n## Figure 12: Beta Band Power Boxplot\nThis boxplot compares beta band power between healthy and parkinsonian groups, with individual data points overlaid. The y-axis shows power values in V\u00b2/Hz on a scientific notation scale. The plot shows that the healthy group has a slightly higher median value and larger spread compared to the parkinsonian group for these specific samples, contrary to what might be expected. This inconsistency with typical findings is explained in the text as likely due to the very small sample size (n=3 per group). The figure is well-formatted, though using different colors for the individual data points might have improved clarity.\n\n## Figure 13: Raw LFP vs. Beta ARV Comparison\nThis figure shows two time-aligned plots: raw LFP data (top) and the derived Beta ARV (bottom) from the same healthy subject. The LFP data shows rapid oscillations with amplitude around \u00b10.003V, while the Beta ARV shows a smoother envelope of beta activity around 0.00002-0.00013V. This visualization effectively demonstrates the relationship between the raw signal and the processed beta measure. Both plots have proper time alignment, allowing comparison of features between the raw and processed signals. No formatting or technical issues are present.\n\nOverall, the visualizations effectively support the exploration of the dataset, though some figures show less clear differences between conditions than might be expected based on the text description of Parkinson's disease characteristics. This is acknowledged in the notebook as potentially due to small sample sizes or the limitations of certain visualization methods.",
