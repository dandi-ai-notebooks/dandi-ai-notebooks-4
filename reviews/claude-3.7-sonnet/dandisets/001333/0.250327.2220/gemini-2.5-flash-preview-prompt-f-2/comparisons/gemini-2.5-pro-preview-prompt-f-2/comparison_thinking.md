- Notebook 2 provides more explanation about each package and its purpose

**Loading Dandiset using DANDI API:**
- Both notebooks include similar code to load the Dandiset using the DANDI API
- Both display basic metadata and list the first 5 assets

**Loading an NWB file and showing metadata:**
- Both notebooks load an NWB file and display basic metadata
- Notebook 1 loads `sub-healthy-simulated-lfp/sub-healthy-simulated-lfp_ses-001_ecephys.nwb`
- Notebook 2 loads `sub-healthy-simulated-beta/sub-healthy-simulated-beta_ses-162_ecephys.nwb`
