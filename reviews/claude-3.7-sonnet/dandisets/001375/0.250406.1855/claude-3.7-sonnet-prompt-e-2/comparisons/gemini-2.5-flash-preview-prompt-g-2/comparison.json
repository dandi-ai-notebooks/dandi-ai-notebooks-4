It includes additional advanced visualizations that help understand the structure and complexity of the data, such as the neural activity correlation matrix and activity heatmap. The explanatory markdown is more extensive, providing better context for understanding the data.\n\nNotebook 2 is more concise and perhaps easier to follow for complete beginners. It has better error handling in the code, making it potentially more robust. However, it covers less ground in terms of data exploration and visualization.\n\nBoth notebooks meet the basic requirements, but Notebook 1 provides a more thorough introduction to the dataset and more examples that would help users understand what kinds of analyses they could do. The visualizations in Notebook 1 are more varied and show more aspects of the data structure.\n\nWhile Notebook 2 is solid, Notebook 1 would leave users with a better understanding of the dataset and more confidence in working with it. Therefore, Notebook 1 appears to be the better notebook according to the criteria.",
