Each trace is offset vertically for visibility, with the y-axis showing signal (\u03bcV) + offset. The figure clearly displays neural activity with visible spike events and slow oscillations. The traces are color-coded and labeled in the legend, making it easy to distinguish between electrodes. The plot is well-formatted with appropriate axes labels, title, and grid lines. No major issues are apparent in this visualization.\n\n## Figure 2: Trial Durations\nThis plot shows the duration of each trial (lap) in the experiment across all 387 trials. The x-axis represents the trial number, and the y-axis shows the duration in seconds. The plot reveals that most trials last between 5-15 seconds, with occasional longer trials. One trial (#215) appears particularly long at over 160 seconds. The visualization is clear with appropriate axes labels, title, and grid lines. There are no major issues with this figure.\n\n## Figure 3: Distribution of Trial Durations\nThis histogram shows the distribution of trial durations, revealing that the vast majority of trials lasted between 7-15 seconds, with very few trials lasting longer. The x-axis shows trial duration in seconds, and the y-axis shows the count. The histogram uses appropriate binning and coloring. There are no issues with this figure, though adding a vertical line for the mean or median duration might have enhanced it.\n\n## Figure 4: Spike Raster Plot (First 100 seconds)\nThis raster plot displays spike times for three selected neurons during the first 100 seconds of the recording. Each horizontal line represents a different unit, and each vertical tick mark represents a spike. Unit 1 (bottom) shows sparse firing, Unit 2 (middle) shows moderate firing, and Unit 3 (top) shows very dense firing. The visualization effectively conveys the different firing patterns of these neurons. One minor issue is that Unit 3's spikes are so dense that they appear as a solid line rather than individual spikes, though this is a limitation of the data rather than the visualization itself.\n\n## Figure 5: Units' Firing Rates Across Trials\nThis figure consists of three subplots, each showing the firing rate of a different neural unit across all trials. The x-axis represents trial number, and the y-axis shows firing rate in Hz. Each subplot includes a horizontal red dashed line indicating the median firing rate. Unit 1 (top) shows varying firing rates around 3.6 Hz, Unit 2 (middle) fluctuates around 20.9 Hz, and Unit 3 (bottom) shows a clear downward trend from ~80 Hz to ~40 Hz before slightly recovering. The visualization clearly demonstrates how firing rates changed throughout the experiment. The figure is well-formatted with appropriate titles, labels, and legends.\n\n## Figure 6: Correlation Between Trial Duration and Firing Rates\nThis figure consists of three scatter plots showing the relationship between trial duration (x-axis) and firing rate (y-axis) for each of the three units. Each plot includes the correlation coefficient (r) and p-value. Unit 1 shows no significant correlation, while Units 2 and 3 show significant negative correlations, indicating lower firing rates during longer trials. The plots are well-formatted with clear labels and titles. The figure effectively demonstrates the statistical relationships between these variables.\n\n## Figure 7: Spike Activity Aligned to Trial Events\nThis figure consists of six raster plots arranged in a 3\u00d72 grid, showing spike times aligned to trial starts (left column) and trial ends (right column) for each of the three units. Each row corresponds to a different unit, with Unit 1 at the top, Unit 2 in the middle, and Unit 3 at the bottom. The x-axis shows time relative to the event (-1 to +1 seconds), and the y-axis shows trial number (0 to 50). Vertical red dashed lines mark the event time (t=0). The visualization effectively shows neural responses around behavioral events. Similar to the previous raster plot, Unit 3's activity is so dense that individual spikes are difficult to distinguish.\n\n## Figure 8: PSTH Aligned to Trial Events\nThis figure shows peristimulus time histograms (PSTHs) for the three units aligned to trial starts (left column) and trial ends (right column). Each subplot shows the average firing rate in 50ms bins from -1 to +1 seconds relative to the event. The x-axis shows time from the event, and the y-axis shows firing rate in Hz. Vertical red dashed lines mark the event time (t=0). This visualization provides a clearer picture of how firing rates change around behavioral events than the raster plots. The figure is well-formatted with appropriate labels and titles.\n\n## Figure 9: Power Spectrum Analysis\nThis figure consists of two power spectrum plots. The top plot shows the full spectrum from 0 to 500 Hz for all six electrodes, while the bottom plot focuses on the 0 to 50 Hz range with physiological frequency bands (Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta) marked with colored backgrounds. The y-axis uses a logarithmic scale to show power spectral density. The plots reveal that most power is in the low frequency range (below 50 Hz), with a typical 1/f pattern. The electrodes from shank1 show higher power across frequencies than those from shank2. The visualization effectively conveys the frequency content of the neural signals with appropriate labels and colored bands indicating frequency ranges of interest.\n\n## Figure 10: Signal Correlation Between Electrodes\nThis heatmap shows the correlation coefficients between the signals recorded from the six selected electrodes. The color scale ranges from -1 (dark purple) to +1 (bright yellow), with correlation values annotated in each cell. The visualization reveals strong positive correlations among electrodes within the same shank, and weaker correlations between electrodes from different shanks. This effectively demonstrates the spatial organization of neural activity. The heatmap is well-formatted with clear labels and an appropriate color scale.\n\nOverall, the figures in this notebook are well-designed, informative, and free of major issues. They effectively convey different aspects of the neural and behavioral data from the experiment.",
