   - Notebook 1: ✓ Clearly outlines notebook contents in a section
   - Notebook 2: ✓ Outlines what will be covered in numbered list

5. **Required packages list**:
   - Notebook 1: ✓ Lists required packages with explanation
   - Notebook 2: ✓ Lists required packages

6. **Loading instructions using DANDI API**:
   - Notebook 1: ✓ Shows how to load Dandiset and list assets
   - Notebook 2: ✓ Shows how to load Dandiset and list assets

7. **Loading NWB file and metadata display**:
   - Notebook 1: ✓ Shows loading an NWB file and displays metadata
   - Notebook 2: ✓ Shows loading an NWB file and displays metadata

8. **Description of NWB file data**:
   - Notebook 1: ✓ Provides detailed description of the NWB file structure with hierarchical display
   - Notebook 2: ✓ Provides a summary of key data interfaces in tree structure

9. **Loading and visualizing data types**:
   - Notebook 1: ✓ Shows loading and visualizing fluorescence data and spatial footprints
   - Notebook 2: ✓ Shows loading and visualizing OnePhotonSeries, EventAmplitude, fluorescence data, and image masks

10. **Advanced visualizations**:

    - Notebook 2: ✓ Shows multiple data types with appropriate visualizations

11. **Summary and future directions**:
    - Notebook 1: ✓ Includes a summary and possible future directions
    - Notebook 2: ✓ Includes a summary and possible future directions

12. **Explanatory markdown cells**:
    - Notebook 1: ✓ Good explanatory text throughout
    - Notebook 2: ✓ Explanatory text throughout

13. **Well-documented code**:
    - Notebook 1: ✓ Code well-documented with comments
    - Notebook 2: ✓ Code reasonably documented but fewer inline comments

14. **Focus on basics without overanalysis**:
    - Notebook 1: ✓ Maintains basic focus
    - Notebook 2: ✓ Maintains basic focus

15. **Clear visualizations**:
    - Notebook 1: ✓ Visualizations are clear, with appropriate titles and labels
    - Notebook 2: ✓ Visualizations are clear, though the image masks visualization had to use assumed dimensions

16. **Neurosift link**:
    - Notebook 1: ✓ Provides Neurosift link for interactive exploration
    - Notebook 2: ✓ Provides Neurosift link for interactive exploration

Overall comparison:

Both notebooks meet the core requirements well. They both have appropriate structure, necessary content sections, and good visualizations. However, there are some differences that make Notebook 1 slightly better:

1. **Error handling**: Notebook 1 includes error handling when reading the NWB file with a try-except block, making it more robust.

2. **Code documentation**: Notebook 1 generally has more thorough inline comments and explanations throughout the code.

3. **NWB file structure explanation**: Notebook 1 provides a more detailed explanation of the NWB file structure.

4. **Visualization clarity**: The fluorescence traces visualization in Notebook 1 includes proper labeling for multiple neurons, which is more instructive.

5. **Detail in explanations**: Notebook 1 provides more detailed explanations about what the data represents and how it relates to the study.

Notebook 2 does have a more comprehensive examination of different data types (including OnePhotonSeries data that Notebook 1 doesn't explore), which is a point in its favor.

However, overall, Notebook 1 appears to be better structured, more thoroughly commented, and provides better explanations of the data structure and content. It would be more helpful for someone trying to get started with the Dandiset.
