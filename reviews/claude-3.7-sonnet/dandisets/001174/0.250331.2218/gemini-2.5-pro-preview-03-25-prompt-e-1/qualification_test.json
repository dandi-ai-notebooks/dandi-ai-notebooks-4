    "image_descriptions": "# Description of Images in the Notebook\n\n## Image 1: Sample Frames from OnePhotonSeries\n- **Overview**: This figure shows three sample frames from the raw calcium imaging data, displaying frames 0, 3013, and 6025 from the OnePhotonSeries. The frames are grayscale images showing the field of view captured during the calcium imaging session. The images appear to be from a microendoscopic imaging setup with a circular field of view (typical of GRIN lens imaging).\n- **Minor issues**: None apparent - the figure has proper axes labels, colorbar, and titles for each frame.\n- **Major issues**: None. The data appears to be valid calcium imaging data with the expected circular field of view and some visible structures that are likely neurons or other cellular elements.\n\n## Image 2: Fluorescence Traces for First 3 ROIs\n- **Overview**: This plot shows the fluorescence activity traces for the first three regions of interest (ROIs) over time (first 500 timepoints, approximately 50 seconds). The traces show characteristic calcium transients with sharp rises followed by slower decays, which is typical of calcium indicator signals.\n- **Minor issues**: None - the plot has appropriate axis labels, legend, and title.\n- **Major issues**: None. The traces show clear calcium events, particularly in the orange trace (ROI ID 1) which shows numerous large transients. This suggests the data capture is meaningful and of good quality.\n\n## Image 3: Individual ROI Image Masks\n- **Overview**: This figure shows the spatial footprints (masks) of the first three ROIs in the dataset. Each mask represents the pixels associated with a detected cell/neuron in the field of view.\n- **Minor issues**: The masks are relatively small compared to the total field of view shown.\n- **Major issues**: None. The masks appear to have the expected shape and distribution for cells in calcium imaging data, with higher intensity cores (active regions of the neuron) indicated by brighter colors.\n\n## Image 4: Overlay of First 3 ROI Masks\n- **Overview**: This figure shows a maximum projection overlay of the three ROI masks, displaying their relative positions in the field of view. The three cells appear as distinct spots in the image.\n- **Minor issues**: None - the figure has appropriate axis labels, colorbar, and title.\n- **Major issues**: None. The overlay shows that the three ROIs are spatially distinct and located in a small region of the total field of view, which is consistent with the sparse distribution often seen in calcium imaging datasets.\n\n## Image 5: Event Amplitudes for First 3 ROIs\n- **Overview**: This plot shows the detected event amplitudes for the first three ROIs over the first 500 timepoints.\n- **Minor issues**: None in terms of formatting.\n- **Major issues**: The data appears to be all zeros (or very close to zero) for the displayed timepoints, suggesting either: (1) no detected events in this time window, (2) the event detection algorithm used may not have identified events, or (3) possibly an issue with how the EventAmplitude data is stored or accessed. This contrasts with the Fluorescence traces which showed clear activity, suggesting this might be specifically related to how events were defined or detected in this dataset.\n\nOverall, the visualizations effectively demonstrate the structure and content of the calcium imaging data, with the possible exception of the Event Amplitudes plot which shows no detected events in the displayed time window.",
