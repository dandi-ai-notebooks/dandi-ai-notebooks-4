    "image_descriptions": "# Description of Images in the Notebook\n\n## Figure 1: \"Sample Frames from OnePhotonSeries\"\n- **Overview**: This figure shows three sample frames from the raw calcium imaging data, displaying frames 0, 3013, and 6025 from the full dataset of 6026 frames. Each frame displays a grayscale image of the field of view (1280\u00d7800 pixels) captured by the one-photon microscope.\n- **Content**: The images show the raw calcium imaging field with subtle variations in brightness across the frames. The circular field of view is visible, with brighter regions in the center and darker edges, which is typical for one-photon calcium imaging through GRIN lenses.\n- **Minor Issues**: None apparent - the figure includes proper axis labels, colorbar, and titles.\n- **Major Issues**: None. The images appropriately display the raw imaging data with good contrast.\n\n## Figure 2: \"Fluorescence Traces for First 3 ROIs (First 500 Timepoints)\"\n- **Overview**: This line plot shows fluorescence activity over time for the first three ROIs (Regions of Interest, representing individual neurons). The data covers the first 500 timepoints (~50 seconds at 10Hz sampling rate).\n- **Content**: The plot reveals different calcium transient patterns for each ROI, with ROI ID 1 (orange line) showing particularly strong and frequent activity. ROI ID 0 (blue) shows less activity, while ROI ID 2 (green) shows occasional small transients.\n- **Minor Issues**: None. The plot has appropriate axes labels, legend, and grid.\n- **Major Issues**: None. The fluorescence traces display expected calcium transient patterns.\n\n## Figure 3: \"Individual ROI Image Masks\"\n- **Overview**: This figure shows the spatial masks for the first three ROIs in the dataset. Each mask indicates where in the imaging field a particular neuron is located.\n- **Content**: Each panel shows a small bright spot representing a neuron against a dark background. These are spatial filters that define the pixels belonging to each cell.\n- **Minor Issues**: The masks appear quite small relative to the full frame size, making it difficult to see precise details of their shape.\n- **Major Issues**: None. The masks appropriately show the spatial location of each ROI.\n\n## Figure 4: \"Overlay of First 3 ROI Masks (Max Projection)\"\n- **Overview**: This figure shows all three ROI masks overlaid in a single image using a maximum projection.\n- **Content**: The image reveals the spatial relationship between the three neurons, showing they are positioned in a roughly triangular arrangement in the field of view.\n- **Minor Issues**: None. The overlay has appropriate colormapping (hot colormap), labels, and colorbar.\n- **Major Issues**: None. The overlay effectively shows the spatial relationships between the ROIs.\n\n## Figure 5: \"Event Amplitudes for First 3 ROIs (First 500 Timepoints)\"\n- **Overview**: This figure is intended to show the detected neural events for the same three ROIs shown in the fluorescence trace plot.\n- **Content**: The plot shows flat lines at zero value for all ROIs, indicating either no detected events in this timeframe or, more likely, that the event detection data is empty or not properly populated in the NWB file.\n- **Minor Issues**: None in terms of formatting.\n- **Major Issues**: The data appears to be all zeros, which suggests either no events were detected in this time window or the event detection data was not properly populated in the dataset. This may warrant investigation if event detection analysis is important for the user's purposes.\n\nOverall, the figures effectively visualize the key components of calcium imaging data: raw imaging frames, ROI spatial locations, and fluorescence time series. The only potential issue is with the event amplitude data which appears to be zeros, but this could be a legitimate characteristic of this particular dataset.",
