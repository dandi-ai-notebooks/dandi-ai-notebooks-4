    "image_descriptions": "# Description of Images in the Notebook\n\n## Image 1: First 10 frames of OnePhotonSeries data\n\n**Overview:**\nThis figure shows a series of 10 grayscale images arranged horizontally, representing the first 10 frames captured from the calcium imaging data. Each frame appears to be a snapshot of neural activity in either the SMA or M1 region of a macaque brain. The frames show subtle variations in brightness across the field of view, with generally brighter centers and darker edges.\n\n**Minor issues:**\n- Individual frames lack time indicators, making it difficult to know the temporal spacing between frames\n- No scale bar to indicate spatial dimensions\n- No colorbar to quantify the intensity values\n- The frames appear to be low contrast, which might make subtle activity changes difficult to perceive\n\n**Major issues:**\n- The images appear to have a strong vignetting effect (darker at edges, brighter in center), which is common in one-photon microscopy but could potentially mask neural activity near the image edges\n- There's no clear cellular structure visible in these frames, suggesting this might be raw data that needs further processing or that the resolution/contrast is not optimal for visualizing individual neurons\n\n## Image 2: Fluorescence Traces for First 10 ROIs (First 100 Timepoints)\n\n**Overview:**\nThis figure displays calcium fluorescence traces for 10 different regions of interest (ROIs), presumably corresponding to 10 different neurons. Each horizontal panel represents the fluorescence activity of one ROI over the first 100 timepoints. The y-axis shows fluorescence intensity, and the x-axis represents time points (frames).\n\n**Minor issues:**\n- The x-axis lacks units (seconds or frames)\n- Y-axis scales vary considerably between ROIs, making direct comparisons difficult\n- No indication of whether these traces are raw or processed (e.g., \u0394F/F)\n\n**Major issues:**\n- Several ROIs (particularly ROI 1, 8, and 9) show essentially flat traces with minimal activity, suggesting they might not contain active cells\n- ROI 4 shows an unusual ramping pattern that increases throughout the recording, which might indicate photobleaching, movement artifact, or other technical issues rather than physiological activity\n- The scale differences between ROIs are extreme (e.g., ROI 4 ranges from 0-50 while ROI 8 ranges from -0.05 to 0.05), suggesting potential issues with ROI definition or signal quality\n\n## Image 3: Summed Image Masks Heatmap\n\n**Overview:**\nThis heatmap visualizes the spatial distribution of all ROIs by summing their image masks. Brighter colors (yellow/green) indicate areas where multiple ROIs overlap, while darker colors (purple/black) indicate areas with no ROIs. The scattered bright spots represent the locations of the identified neurons or ROIs across the field of view.\n\n**Minor issues:**\n- No scale bar to indicate spatial dimensions\n- Axes are marked with pixel numbers rather than physical dimensions\n- The colorbar scale doesn't have a clear label explaining what the values represent (number of overlapping ROIs)\n\n**Major issues:**\n- The ROIs appear sparse and somewhat small relative to the field of view, with most of the image being empty space\n- Only a few areas show overlapping ROIs (brighter spots), which might indicate a low cell density or conservative ROI detection\n- The distribution of ROIs shows some spatial patterning, with certain regions having clusters of ROIs while other regions are empty, which could reflect true biological distribution or potential biases in ROI detection\n\nIn summary, the visualizations provide a basic view of the calcium imaging data but would benefit from additional processing, clearer labeling, and more context to facilitate interpretation. The quality of the raw frames appears adequate, though the fluorescence traces show some potentially problematic patterns that would warrant further investigation before conducting deeper analyses.",
