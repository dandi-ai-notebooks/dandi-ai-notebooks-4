    "image_descriptions": "I'll provide a detailed description of each of the three images/figures in the notebook:\n\n### Figure 1: First 10 frames of OnePhotonSeries data\n\n**Overview:**\nThis figure shows a horizontal display of 10 grayscale images representing the first 10 frames from a calcium imaging recording session. Each frame captures raw neuronal activity from the SMA (Supplementary Motor Area) region of a macaque brain. The images appear as oval-shaped fields of view with brightness variations across the field.\n\n**Minor issues:**\n- No scale bar is provided to indicate the spatial resolution of the images.\n- The frames lack individual titles or timestamps to indicate when each frame was captured.\n- There are no axes labels, though they were intentionally turned off with `axes[i].axis('off')`.\n\n**Major issues:**\n- The frames appear fairly uniform with limited contrast, making it difficult to distinguish specific neurons or activity patterns. This could be due to either low signal-to-noise ratio in the raw data or the need for pre-processing.\n- Without additional context about the spatial scale or what specific anatomical features should be visible, the scientific utility of these images is limited.\n\n### Figure 2: Fluorescence Traces for First 10 ROIs (First 100 Timepoints)\n\n**Overview:**\nThis figure presents calcium fluorescence traces for 10 different regions of interest (ROIs) over 100 timepoints. Each horizontal subplot represents the activity of one neuron (ROI) over time, with the y-axis showing fluorescence intensity and the x-axis representing time (in frames or timepoints).\n\n**Minor issues:**\n- The y-axis scales are inconsistent across ROIs, making direct comparison between neurons difficult.\n- The x-axis lacks units (seconds, minutes, etc.).\n- No indication of the temporal resolution (e.g., frames per second) is provided.\n\n**Major issues:**\n- Some ROIs (1, 8, and 9) show nearly flat lines with minimal activity, which could indicate either inactive neurons or poor ROI selection.\n- The dramatic scale differences between ROIs (e.g., ROI 4 reaches values of 50+ while others are below 1) suggest potential issues with normalization or baseline correction.\n- Without additional behavioral or experimental context, it's difficult to interpret the meaning of the observed activity patterns.\n\n### Figure 3: Summed Image Masks Heatmap\n\n**Overview:**\nThis heatmap visualizes the spatial distribution and overlap of ROIs (neuron locations) in the calcium imaging field of view. Brighter colors (yellow-green) indicate areas where multiple ROIs overlap, while darker areas (purple) have few or no ROIs. The individual spots likely represent the locations of neurons that were identified and tracked during the experiment.\n\n**Minor issues:**\n- The axes are labeled with pixel coordinates, but there's no scale bar or indication of physical dimensions.\n- The colorbar scale goes from 0 to approximately 1.6, but it's not clear what these values represent (likely the count of overlapping ROIs).\n\n**Major issues:**\n- The spatial distribution of ROIs appears sparse, which could indicate either selective neuron labeling, conservative ROI detection, or issues with the calcium indicator expression.\n- Without an overlay of the average image or anatomical reference, it's difficult to interpret the spatial organization of these neurons relative to brain structures.\n- The figure doesn't provide information about how these ROIs were generated or validated.\n\nOverall, while these figures provide a basic visualization of the calcium imaging data, they would benefit from additional context, consistent scaling, clearer labeling, and supplementary information about the experimental conditions to maximize their interpretability and scientific value.",
