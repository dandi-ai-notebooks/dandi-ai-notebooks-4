    "image_descriptions": "# Analysis of Images in the Notebook\n\nThis notebook contains two key visualizations related to calcium imaging data from Dandiset 001174:\n\n## Figure 1: Fluorescence Traces for All ROIs (First 1000 timepoints)\n\n### Overview\nThis figure shows fluorescence traces from 6 different ROIs (Regions of Interest) over approximately 100 seconds of recording time. The x-axis represents time in seconds, and the y-axis shows fluorescence intensity. Each colored line represents a different ROI (numbered 0-5).\n\nThe traces show characteristic calcium transients - brief spikes in fluorescence that likely correspond to neuronal activity. Different ROIs show distinct activity patterns:\n- ROI 3 (red) shows several prominent peaks reaching fluorescence values above 10\n- ROI 5 (brown) shows frequent activity with several high-amplitude events\n- Other ROIs (0, 1, 2, 4) show more moderate activity patterns\n\n### Minor Issues\n- None observed - the figure has proper axes labels, a clear title, and a legend identifying each ROI\n\n### Major Issues\n- None observed - the data appears to show biologically plausible calcium imaging signals with expected transient activity patterns\n\n## Figure 2: All ROI Image Masks (Max Projection, 6 ROIs)\n\n### Overview\nThis figure shows the spatial locations of 6 identified ROIs in the imaging field. The visualization is a maximum projection, meaning for each pixel, the highest value across all ROI masks is displayed. \n\nThe image shows:\n- 6 distinct bright regions corresponding to the detected ROIs\n- The ROIs are clustered in the lower half of the imaging field\n- Each ROI appears as a small, roughly circular bright spot with intensity values that fade from center to edge\n- The image dimensions are 318\u00d7198 pixels\n- A colorbar indicates mask values ranging from 0-1\n\n### Minor Issues\n- The grid lines might be somewhat distracting, though they do help with identifying precise ROI locations\n\n### Major Issues\n- None observed - the ROI masks appear as expected for calcium imaging data, showing discrete regions that likely correspond to individual neurons or small clusters of neurons\n\nBoth visualizations are well-executed and provide complementary information - the temporal activity patterns (Figure 1) and spatial locations (Figure 2) of the neurons being recorded in this calcium imaging dataset.",
