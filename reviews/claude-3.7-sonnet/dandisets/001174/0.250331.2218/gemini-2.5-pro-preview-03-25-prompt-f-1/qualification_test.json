    "image_descriptions": "# Description of Images in the Notebook\n\nThere are two images in this notebook:\n\n## Image 1: Fluorescence Traces for All ROIs (First 1000 timepoints)\n\n**Overview:**\nThis figure shows the fluorescence traces for 6 ROIs (Regions of Interest) over the first 100 seconds of calcium imaging recording. The x-axis represents time in seconds (from 0 to approximately 100 seconds), and the y-axis shows fluorescence intensity in arbitrary fluorescence units. Each colored line represents a different ROI (labeled as ROI 0 through ROI 5 in the legend). The traces show transient increases in fluorescence (calcium events), which likely correspond to neuronal activity.\n\n**Minor Issues:**\n- None apparent. The figure is well-formatted with proper axis labels, a clear title, and a legend that distinguishes between the different ROIs.\n\n**Major Issues:**\n- None. The visualization effectively shows the calcium transients for all ROIs, allowing the viewer to observe differences in activity patterns across neurons.\n\n## Image 2: All ROI Image Masks (Max Projection, 6 ROIs)\n\n**Overview:**\nThis figure shows the spatial locations of the 6 ROIs identified in the recording session. The image is a maximum projection of all ROI masks onto a single image. The x and y axes represent pixel coordinates within the imaging field (approximately 198 pixels wide by 318 pixels high). The colored spots represent the locations of the 6 ROIs, with color intensity (represented in the colorbar) indicating the contribution of each pixel to the ROI (values from 0 to 1). The ROIs appear as small, bright spots mostly concentrated in the lower half of the image.\n\n**Minor Issues:**\n- The grid lines might be slightly distracting given the sparse nature of the data, but they do help with identifying the exact locations of the ROIs.\n\n**Major Issues:**\n- None. The visualization clearly shows the spatial distribution of the ROIs. The ROIs are well-separated and appear to be properly defined with varying intensities at their centers fading toward the edges, which is what you would expect from well-defined regions containing neuronal cell bodies in calcium imaging data.\n\nBoth visualizations effectively represent the data from the NWB file and provide good initial insights into the calcium imaging recordings in this dataset.",
