    "image_descriptions": "Based on the notebook code, there would be three figures generated. However, I can only describe what each figure would theoretically show since I don't have access to the actual rendered images from execution. Here are detailed descriptions of what each figure would display if the notebook were executed:\n\n### Figure 1: OnePhotonSeries - First Frame\n**Overview:**\n- This figure would display the first frame captured from the one-photon calcium imaging series.\n- It should show a grayscale image representing fluorescence intensity across the field of view.\n- The colorbar would indicate the intensity values.\n\n**Minor issues:**\n- No apparent minor issues in the code. The figure includes proper axis labels, a title, and a colorbar.\n\n**Major issues:**\n- Cannot determine if there would be data quality issues since we don't see the actual rendered image.\n- If `first_frame` contains all zeros or NaN values, the image would be uninformative.\n- If the frame dimensions are very large or very small, the visualization might not be optimal with the chosen figure size (6, 4).\n\n### Figure 2: EventAmplitude for First 5 ROIs\n**Overview:**\n- This figure would display time series traces of calcium event amplitudes for the first 5 regions of interest (ROIs).\n- Each line represents a different ROI, showing how its activity changes over time.\n- The x-axis represents time in seconds, calculated from the event rate.\n\n**Minor issues:**\n- The time calculation assumes that the data points are evenly spaced. If there are missing timepoints, this could be misleading.\n- The legend is placed at 'upper right' which might overlap with data if the traces have high values in that region.\n\n**Major issues:**\n- The code extracts ROI IDs from `ea.rois.table.id[:5]`, but if these IDs don't match the order of data in `ea.data[:, idx]`, the labels would be incorrect.\n- If the calcium event data has artifacts or is very noisy, the traces might be difficult to interpret without further processing.\n\n### Figure 3: Max Projection of ROI Masks\n**Overview:**\n- This figure would show a maximum intensity projection of all ROI masks.\n- It combines all the ROI masks into a single image, showing the maximum value at each pixel position.\n- The 'hot' colormap would highlight regions with higher values (likely areas with overlapping ROIs).\n\n**Minor issues:**\n- The figure size (5, 5) may not maintain the proper aspect ratio of the original imaging data.\n- Without scale bars or spatial calibration, it's difficult to interpret the physical dimensions.\n\n**Major issues:**\n- If the ROI masks are binary (0s and 1s), the max projection will only show areas with ROIs but won't distinguish well between areas with few vs. many overlapping ROIs.\n- If there are many ROIs, the projection could become oversaturated and hard to interpret.\n- If the `image_mask` field contains improperly formatted data, the projection could be meaningless.\n\nFor all figures, we would need to see the actual rendered output to fully assess data quality and identify any visualization issues that aren't apparent from the code alone.",
