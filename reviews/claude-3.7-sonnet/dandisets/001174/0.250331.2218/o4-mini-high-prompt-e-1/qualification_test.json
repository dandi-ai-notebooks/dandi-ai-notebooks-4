    "image_descriptions": "Based on the notebook code, there are three figures that would be generated, though I don't have direct access to the rendered images. I'll describe what each figure would show based on the code, and provide commentary on potential issues:\n\n### Figure 1: OnePhotonSeries First Frame\n**Overview:**\nThis figure displays the first frame from the calcium imaging data (OnePhotonSeries). It's a grayscale image showing the raw fluorescence intensity values captured during imaging of the macaque SMA and M1 brain regions.\n\n**Minor issues:**\n- The figure size (6, 4) might be small for detailed examination of neural structures.\n- No scale bar is included, making it difficult to determine the physical dimensions.\n\n**Major issues:**\n- Without context on expected image quality or brain region layout, it's difficult to assess if the visualization adequately represents the data.\n- No indication of spatial orientation (anterior/posterior, medial/lateral) which would be important for neuroanatomical interpretation.\n\n### Figure 2: EventAmplitude for First 5 ROIs\n**Overview:**\nThis figure shows time series plots of event amplitude (derived from calcium fluorescence) for the first 5 regions of interest (ROIs), which likely represent individual neurons or small groups of neurons.\n\n**Minor issues:**\n- The time axis shows seconds, but without context of the experimental timeline or behavioral events.\n- The legend with \"ROI {id}\" doesn't provide biological context about what these ROIs represent.\n\n**Major issues:**\n- Time is calculated as `np.arange(ea.data.shape[0]) / ea.rate`, which assumes the data starts at time zero. If there are offsets in the recording, this could misrepresent the timeline.\n- Only showing 5 ROIs from what could be hundreds or thousands provides a very limited view of the dataset.\n\n### Figure 3: Max Projection of ROI Masks\n**Overview:**\nThis figure shows a maximum intensity projection of all ROI masks overlaid together, giving a spatial map of where all identified neurons/ROIs are located in the imaging field.\n\n**Minor issues:**\n- The 'hot' colormap is used but may not be optimal for visualizing spatial overlap of ROIs.\n- As with the first figure, there's no scale bar or anatomical orientation markers.\n\n**Major issues:**\n- Maximum projection will show overlap but doesn't distinguish between different ROIs - areas with many overlapping ROIs will just appear brighter.\n- No indication of how many total ROIs are represented in this projection, which is important context.\n- No attempt to separate ROIs by layer, region, or other neuroanatomical features that might be biologically relevant.\n\nFor all figures, adding more context about what exactly is being visualized (e.g., cortical surface, specific cortical layers) would greatly improve interpretability. Additionally, connecting these visualizations to the experimental design or behavioral aspects mentioned in the Dandiset would make them more meaningful for scientific interpretation.",
