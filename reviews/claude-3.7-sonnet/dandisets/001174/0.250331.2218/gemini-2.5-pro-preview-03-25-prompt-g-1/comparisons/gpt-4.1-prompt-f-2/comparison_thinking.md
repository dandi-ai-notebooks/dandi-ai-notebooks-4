- More comprehensive error handling
- Shows raw imaging data
- More detailed suggestions for future analysis

Notebook 2 strengths:
- More concise and focused explanations
- Better formatted and more visually appealing plots
- More complete citation information for the Dandiset
- Cleaner code overall
- Better ROI mask visualization showing both combined and individual views

While both notebooks are good, Notebook 2 seems more polished and user-friendly for someone getting started with the Dandiset. Its explanations are sufficient without being overly verbose, and its visualizations are cleaner. The approach to showing both a combined ROI mask heatmap and a single example ROI gives better insight into the spatial structure. The code is also cleaner and more concise, making it easier to follow. Therefore, Notebook 2 is slightly better overall.
