    "image_descriptions": "# Description of Images in the Notebook\n\n## Image 1: Fluorescence Traces\nThis figure shows fluorescence traces for 11 regions of interest (ROIs) over time. The x-axis displays time in seconds (showing the first 100 seconds of recording), and the y-axis shows fluorescence intensity values. Each colored line represents a different ROI's activity over time. The traces show various patterns of neural activity with different amplitudes and temporal dynamics. Some ROIs exhibit strong transient increases in fluorescence (likely calcium signals associated with neural firing), while others show more sustained patterns of activity. For example, the red trace shows a prolonged elevated response between approximately 20-70 seconds.\n\n**Minor issues:** None apparent; the figure is well-labeled with appropriate axes, title, and units.\n\n**Major issues:** None. The visualization effectively represents the fluorescence data.\n\n## Image 2: ROI Image Masks\nThis figure shows the spatial footprints (masks) of the 11 ROIs superimposed in a single maximum projection image. The image reveals the spatial distribution of ROIs across the field of view, with each bright spot representing the location of an identified neuron or cellular component. The color scale indicates the intensity value of the masks (0-1). The ROIs appear as distinct, well-separated regions distributed primarily in the upper portion of the imaging field.\n\n**Minor issues:** None; the visualization includes proper labels, colorbar, and title.\n\n**Major issues:** None. The spatial distribution of ROIs is clearly visible.\n\n## Image 3: Example Frame from OnePhotonSeries\nThis image shows a single raw frame (frame 0) from the calcium imaging data. It displays the full field of view (1280 x 800 pixels) from the one-photon microscope. The image appears to show a relatively uniform grayscale background with some gradient patterns and slight vignetting (darker corners/edges). There are likely structures visible, but without enhancement or contrast adjustment, individual neurons may not be easily distinguishable in this raw frame.\n\n**Minor issues:** None; the figure is properly labeled with axes, title, and colorbar.\n\n**Major issues:** The raw frame doesn't clearly show cellular structures, which is common with single frames of calcium imaging data. Typically, additional processing like background subtraction or temporal averaging would help enhance visibility of neural structures.\n\n## Image 4: Event Amplitudes\nThis figure shows event amplitude traces for the same 11 ROIs over approximately 100 seconds. Unlike the continuous fluorescence traces in the first figure, this plot shows discrete vertical lines representing detected neural events (likely calcium transients). The y-axis displays the amplitude of these events in fluorescence units. The sparse nature of the plot indicates that neural activity is represented as discrete events rather than continuous traces.\n\n**Minor issues:** None; the visualization includes proper labels, title, and grid lines.\n\n**Major issues:** None. The visualization effectively represents the event amplitude data, showing the discrete nature of neural events detected in the calcium imaging data.",
