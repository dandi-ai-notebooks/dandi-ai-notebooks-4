    "image_descriptions": "# Description of Images in the Notebook\n\n## Image 1: Fluorescence Traces Plot\n- **Overview**: This figure shows fluorescence traces for 11 ROIs (Regions of Interest) over the first 100 seconds of recording. Each colored line represents a different neuron/ROI. The x-axis shows time in seconds, and the y-axis shows fluorescence intensity.\n- **Observations**: Several ROIs show clear calcium transients occurring at different times, with peak fluorescence values ranging from around 5 to nearly 50 units. One ROI (shown in red) displays a particularly sustained elevated activity between approximately 20-60 seconds.\n- **Minor issues**: None - the plot is well-formatted with proper axis labels, title, and grid lines.\n- **Major issues**: None - the data appears biologically plausible for calcium imaging recordings.\n\n## Image 2: ROI Image Masks\n- **Overview**: This figure shows the spatial locations of the 11 ROIs in the field of view. It's a maximum projection of all ROI masks, where brighter colors (yellow) indicate higher mask values.\n- **Observations**: The ROIs appear as concentrated bright spots distributed across the imaging field. The masks have proper spatial structure with central bright regions that fade toward the edges.\n- **Minor issues**: None - the visualization includes appropriate color scaling, axis labels, and title.\n- **Major issues**: None - the ROI masks appear to have reasonable spatial distributions and sizes for neuronal cell bodies.\n\n## Image 3: Example Frame from OnePhotonSeries\n- **Overview**: This figure shows the first frame (frame 0) from the raw imaging data. It displays the full field of view (800 x 1280 pixels) as captured by the microscope.\n- **Observations**: The frame shows a gradient of brightness across the field, which is common in microscopy due to uneven illumination. The darker edges and brighter center are typical for this type of imaging.\n- **Minor issues**: None - the visualization includes appropriate grayscale mapping and axis labels.\n- **Major issues**: None - while individual neurons aren't easily visible in this raw frame (which is expected), the overall image quality appears reasonable for one-photon calcium imaging.\n\n## Image 4: Event Amplitudes Plot\n- **Overview**: This figure shows detected neural event amplitudes for the 11 ROIs over approximately 100 seconds. Unlike the continuous fluorescence traces, these appear as discrete events with varying amplitudes.\n- **Observations**: The events are represented as vertical lines, with heights corresponding to the amplitude of detected calcium events. Maximum amplitudes reach approximately 14 units of fluorescence.\n- **Minor issues**: None - the plot is well-formatted with proper labels and title.\n- **Major issues**: None - the event detection appears to have worked well, showing discrete neural activation events that correspond to the peaks seen in the fluorescence traces (Image 1).\n\nAll visualizations appear appropriate for calcium imaging data and are consistent with what would be expected from calcium imaging in motor cortex areas during a reaching task.",
