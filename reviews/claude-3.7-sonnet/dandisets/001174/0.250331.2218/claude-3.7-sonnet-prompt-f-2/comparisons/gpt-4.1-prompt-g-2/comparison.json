It includes:\n\n1. More diverse visualizations (raw imaging frame, ROI masks, fluorescence traces, event amplitude, event frequency)\n2. More detailed explanations of the data and what the visualizations represent\n3. More advanced analyses (event detection, ROI analysis)\n4. Better progression from basic to advanced topics\n5. More attention to helping users understand the structure and content of the data\n\nNotebook 2 is more concise but lacks the depth of Notebook 1. It provides a basic introduction but doesn't explore the data as thoroughly.\n\nNotebook 1 better answers the guiding questions:\n- It provides a more comprehensive understanding of the Dandiset's purpose and content\n- It gives more confidence in accessing different data types\n- It offers better understanding of NWB file structure\n- It has more visualizations that help understand key aspects\n- It better shows the structure and complexity of the data\n- It gives more ideas for further analyses\n- It provides more reusable code for exploring the Dandiset\n\nWhile both notebooks are well-structured and follow good practices, Notebook 1 is clearly superior in terms of content, depth, and educational value for someone looking to explore this Dandiset.\n\nBased on this assessment, Notebook 1 is better.",
