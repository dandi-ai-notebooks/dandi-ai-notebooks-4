    "image_descriptions": "I'll provide a detailed description of each figure in the notebook:\n\n## Figure 1: Event Amplitude - ROI Plots\n\n### Overview:\nThis figure consists of three subplots showing event amplitude (fluorescence) over time for three different Regions of Interest (ROIs). Each subplot represents a different ROI (0, 1, and 2) from the calcium imaging data.\n\n- The data appears to be from well-detected calcium events, showing sparse activity patterns typical of calcium imaging data\n- The x-axis shows time in seconds (ranging from 0 to approximately 600 seconds)\n- The y-axis shows fluorescence intensity (event amplitude)\n- Each ROI shows different patterns of activity with distinct calcium transients (sharp peaks)\n\n### Minor Issues:\n- None apparent; the plot is well-formatted with clear axes labels, titles, and gridlines\n\n### Major Issues:\n- No major issues. The data appears to be legitimate calcium imaging event amplitude data, with appropriate ranges and characteristics of calcium transients (sparse, discrete events with rapid rise and slower decay)\n\n## Figure 2: Superimposed Image Masks\n\n### Overview:\nThis figure shows a heatmap of superimposed image masks for all ROIs in the dataset. These masks represent the spatial footprints of the identified neurons in the field of view.\n\n- The image shows several distinct clusters (approximately 7-8 visible ROIs/cells)\n- The color scale represents intensity values from 0 to 1\n- The cells appear to be clustered in the lower half of the field of view\n- The x and y axes represent pixel coordinates in the image\n\n### Minor Issues:\n- None apparent; the figure includes appropriate color bar, axis labels, and title\n\n### Major Issues:\n- No major issues with the visualization itself\n- The spatial distribution of ROIs is somewhat limited to the lower portion of the field of view, which could be due to the nature of the recording or the way the miniscope was positioned, but this is not necessarily a problem with the figure itself\n\nBoth figures appropriately represent calcium imaging data: the temporal activity (event amplitudes) and spatial distribution (image masks) of the detected neurons. The data appears biologically plausible and properly formatted.",
