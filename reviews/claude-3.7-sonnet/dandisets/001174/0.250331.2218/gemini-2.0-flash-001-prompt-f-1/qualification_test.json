    "image_descriptions": "# Review of Images in the Notebook\n\nThere are two main images/figures in the notebook:\n\n## Figure 1: EventAmplitude Time Series\n\n**Overview:**\nThis figure shows the fluorescence event amplitude over time for three regions of interest (ROIs). It consists of three subplots stacked vertically, each representing data from a different ROI (0, 1, and 2). The x-axis represents time in seconds (spanning approximately 0-600 seconds), and the y-axis represents fluorescence intensity.\n\n**Key observations:**\n- All three ROIs show sparse activity patterns with clear calcium events (sharp peaks)\n- ROI 0 shows multiple events distributed throughout the recording\n- ROI 1 has fewer events, with concentrated activity around 100s and after 500s\n- ROI 2 shows most of its activity concentrated around 300-400s with some events at the end\n\n**Minor issues:**\n- No issues with labels or formatting\n- The figure is well-structured with clear titles for each subplot\n\n**Major issues:**\n- No major issues with the data representation\n- The data appears to be appropriately visualized for calcium imaging event amplitudes\n\n## Figure 2: Superimposed Image Masks\n\n**Overview:**\nThis figure shows a heatmap of superimposed image masks for all ROIs in the dataset. The image is displayed using a viridis colormap (purple to yellow), with intensity values ranging from 0 to 1. The x and y axes represent pixel coordinates.\n\n**Key observations:**\n- There are approximately 6-7 distinct bright spots visible in the lower half of the image\n- The ROIs appear to be clustered in a specific region of the field of view (lower middle and right portions)\n- The masks appear to have different sizes and intensities, with the brightest reaching values of 1.0 (yellow)\n\n**Minor issues:**\n- No issues with axes labels or formatting\n- The colorbar and title are clearly visible\n\n**Major issues:**\n- Most of the image area is empty (dark purple), which might indicate that the ROIs are concentrated in a small portion of the field of view\n- It would be helpful to know the actual dimensions of the field of view in microns, but this information isn't provided in the figure\n- It's unclear if the limited number of ROIs visible is expected for this type of data or if there might be an issue with the segmentation or mask extraction\n\nOverall, both figures effectively visualize the key aspects of the calcium imaging data, showing both the temporal dynamics (event amplitudes) and spatial distribution (image masks) of the recorded neural activity.",
