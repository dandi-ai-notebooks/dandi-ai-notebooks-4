### Key Differences between the notebooks:

1. **Sniff data rhythmicity detection**: Notebook 2 investigates the discrepancy between annotated breathing events and actual breathing patterns in the raw data more thoroughly, which provides a better understanding of the dataset structure.

2. **Statistical reliability**: Notebook 2 includes confidence intervals in the sniff-triggered analysis, which provides more information about the statistical reliability of the observed patterns.

3. **Interactive resources**: Notebook 2 provides a neurosift link for interactive exploration, enhancing the user experience.

4. **Breathing pattern analysis**: Notebook 2 includes a more detailed analysis of breathing patterns over time.

5. **Presentation of findings**: Notebook 2's presentation of the relationship between breathing and neural activity is slightly more detailed and includes better explanations of the significance of breathing-neural coupling.

While both notebooks are high quality and cover similar content, Notebook 2 has slight advantages in terms of statistical analysis, interactive resources, and explanation depth.

Overall, Notebook 2 is slightly better based on the criteria provided.
