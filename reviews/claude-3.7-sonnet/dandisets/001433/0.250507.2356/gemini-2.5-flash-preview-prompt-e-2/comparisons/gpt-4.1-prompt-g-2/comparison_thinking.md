### Loading the Dandiset
- Notebook 1: Clear code for loading the Dandiset using DANDI API ✓
- Notebook 2: Clear code for loading the Dandiset using DANDI API ✓
Both have almost identical code for this section. Equal on this criterion.

### Loading an NWB File
- Notebook 1: Loads a file with a brief explanation ✓
- Notebook 2: Loads a file with a more detailed explanation including the asset ID and links to Neurosift ✓
Notebook 2 provides more context and useful links. Edge to Notebook 2.

### NWB File Contents Description
- Notebook 1: Explores the contents through interactive code and print statements ✓
- Notebook 2: Provides a structured overview in markdown, plus a tree representation of the acquisition contents ✓
Notebook 2 presents the structure more clearly. Edge to Notebook 2.

### Data Visualization
- Notebook 1: Visualizes LFP and sniff signal data, with a combined visualization ✓
- Notebook 2: Visualizes LFP and sniff signal data, with a combined visualization, and adds a power spectrum analysis ✓
Both have good visualizations, but Notebook 2 adds spectral analysis which is valuable. Edge to Notebook 2.

### Explanatory Markdown

### Additional Considerations
- Notebook 2 includes a power spectrum analysis which is a valuable addition for neurophysiology data
- Notebook 2 provides a clearer structure of the NWB file content through markdown rather than just code output
- Notebook 2 provides the Neurosift link more prominently

### Overall Assessment
Both notebooks are high quality and meet most of the criteria well. However, Notebook 2 offers slightly better:
1. Structure and organization
2. More comprehensive overview of the data
3. Additional analysis (power spectrum)
4. Better explanation of NWB file structure
5. More detailed context for the file being examined

For these reasons, Notebook 2 is the better choice as a starting point for exploring this Dandiset.
