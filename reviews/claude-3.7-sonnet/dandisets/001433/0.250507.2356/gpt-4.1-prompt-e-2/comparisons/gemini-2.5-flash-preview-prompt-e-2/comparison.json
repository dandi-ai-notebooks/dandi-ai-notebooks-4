    "thinking": "Let me compare the two notebooks based on the provided criteria:\n\n### Title and AI Disclaimer\n- Both notebooks have the same title including the Dandiset name\n- Both include an AI disclaimer, though formatted slightly differently\n\n### Overview and Structure\n- Notebook 1 has a more detailed overview of the Dandiset, including citation, contributors, creation date, license, and techniques\n- Both notebooks provide the link to the Dandiset\n- Notebook 1 has more detailed explanations in its markdown cells throughout\n- Notebook 1's section on \"What this notebook covers\" is more comprehensive than Notebook 2's summary\n\n### Required Packages\n- Both notebooks list the required packages\n- Neither includes installation instructions, as specified in the criteria\n\n### Loading Dandiset and Files\n- Both notebooks demonstrate how to load the Dandiset using the DANDI API\n- Both list the first 5 assets and load the same example NWB file\n- Both show metadata from the NWB file\n\n### Data Description\n- Notebook 1 provides a more detailed summary of the NWB file contents with a hierarchical structure outline\n- Notebook 1 enumerates acquisition objects with more context\n- Both explain the key data types (LFP, SniffSignal, behavioral events)\n\n### Data Visualization\n- Both notebooks visualize LFP and sniff signal data\n- Notebook 1 has clearer plots with better labeling and formatting\n- Notebook 2 shows more channels in its LFP plot\n- Both show a combined visualization of LFP and sniff signal data\n- Notebook 1 z-scores the data for better comparison in the combined plot, which is a better approach\n- Notebook 1 includes analysis of inhalation/exhalation intervals with a histogram, which Notebook 2 doesn't have\n\n### Best Practices and Documentation\n- Notebook 1 has more detailed comments within code cells\n- Notebook 1 has more detailed explanations in markdown cells\n\n### Summary and Future Directions\n- Both notebooks include a good summary and suggestions for future directions\n- Notebook 1's summary is slightly more detailed\n\n### Overall Assessment\nNotebook 1 is generally more comprehensive, with better explanations, more detailed context, and clearer visualizations. The code is better commented, and the markdown cells provide more guidance. The z-scoring approach for comparing LFP and sniff signal is more methodologically sound than plotting with dual y-axes as in Notebook 2.\n\nWhile both notebooks cover the basic requirements, Notebook 1 does a better job of introducing the Dandiset and guiding users through exploration of the data.",
