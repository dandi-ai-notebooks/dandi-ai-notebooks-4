Each channel is plotted with a vertical offset to make them visually distinguishable. The y-axis shows voltage with an artificial offset added, and the x-axis shows time in seconds. The figure shows oscillatory patterns in the LFP signals, with Channel 4 (purple line) displaying notably larger amplitude fluctuations compared to the other channels. The signals show rhythmic activity that could be related to breathing or other neural oscillations. No major issues are present in this figure, though the y-axis label \"Voltage (V) + offset\" could be clearer about the magnitude of the offset applied to each channel.\n\n## Figure 2: Spectrogram of First LFP Channel (First 60 seconds)\nThis spectrogram visualizes the frequency content of the first LFP channel over 60 seconds. The x-axis represents time in seconds, the y-axis shows frequency in Hz (limited to 0-100 Hz), and the color represents power spectral density in dB. The figure shows strong power in the low frequency range (0-10 Hz), which is consistent with theta and delta oscillations typically found in the olfactory bulb. There appears to be a relatively uniform distribution of power across time, suggesting consistent oscillatory activity throughout the recording period. The figure is well-formatted with appropriate axis labels and a color bar. No major issues are evident.\n\n## Figure 3: Raw Sniff Signal (First 20 seconds)\nThis figure displays the raw sniffing signal recorded from a thermistor that measures the animal's breathing. The x-axis shows time in seconds (0-20), and the y-axis shows amplitude in volts. The signal shows clear rhythmic oscillations corresponding to the animal's breathing cycles, with negative peaks likely representing inhalation and positive peaks representing exhalation. The breathing pattern appears regular with some variations in amplitude and frequency. No significant issues are present in this figure.\n\n## Figure 4: Raw Sniff Signal with Detected Breathing Events\nThis figure shows the raw sniffing signal over 30 seconds with automatically detected inhalation events (red downward triangles) and exhalation events (green upward triangles). The detection algorithm appears to have successfully identified the breathing cycles, with inhalations corresponding to negative peaks and exhalations to positive peaks. The breathing pattern shows some variability in rate and amplitude over time. The figure is well-labeled and the detection markers are clearly visible. No major issues are evident.\n\n## Figure 5: Breathing Period and Frequency Over Time\nThis is a two-panel figure showing:\n1. Top panel: Breathing period (in seconds) over time\n2. Bottom panel: Breathing frequency (in Hz) over time\n\nBoth panels use the same x-axis (time in seconds) and show the variability in the animal's breathing rhythm. The breathing period generally ranges from about 0.1 to 0.4 seconds with occasional longer periods (up to ~0.9 seconds). Correspondingly, the breathing frequency mostly ranges from about 3 to 10 Hz. There are several distinct moments where the breathing dramatically slows down (shown as spikes in the period plot and dips in the frequency plot), which might represent specific behavioral states or events. The figure effectively illustrates the dynamic nature of breathing patterns in freely behaving animals. No significant issues are present.\n\n## Figure 6: Simultaneous Raw Sniff Signal and LFP Activity\nThis three-panel figure shows the temporal alignment between breathing and neural activity:\n1. Top panel: Raw sniff signal\n2. Middle panel: LFP from Channel 0\n3. Bottom panel: LFP from Channel 1\n\nAll three panels share the same x-axis (time in seconds, 0-10) and include vertical green dashed lines marking detected inhalation events. This visualization allows for direct comparison of the timing between breathing events and neural activity. The figure suggests some relationship between the breathing rhythm and fluctuations in the LFP signals, particularly around inhalation events. The figure is well-organized and properly labeled. The green dashed lines effectively highlight the relationship between the signals.\n\n## Figure 7: Sniff-Triggered Average LFP\nThis two-panel figure shows:\n1. Top panel: Sniff-triggered average LFP for Channel 0\n2. Bottom panel: Sniff-triggered average LFP for Channel 1\n\nBoth panels display the average LFP response aligned to inhalation events (marked by a vertical green dashed line at time 0). The x-axis shows time relative to inhalation (-0.5 to 1.0 seconds), and the y-axis shows average voltage. The blue shaded regions represent the standard error of the mean, indicating the reliability of the average. \n\nBoth channels show a similar pattern: a negative deflection just before inhalation, followed by a strong positive peak shortly after inhalation, then a negative trough, and finally a return to baseline with some oscillations. This pattern indicates a consistent relationship between breathing and neural activity in the olfactory bulb. The figure is well-formatted with clear labeling, and the sample size (n=46) is noted in the titles.\n\nAll the figures effectively support the notebook's analysis of the relationship between breathing rhythms and neural activity in the olfactory bulb of freely behaving mice.",
