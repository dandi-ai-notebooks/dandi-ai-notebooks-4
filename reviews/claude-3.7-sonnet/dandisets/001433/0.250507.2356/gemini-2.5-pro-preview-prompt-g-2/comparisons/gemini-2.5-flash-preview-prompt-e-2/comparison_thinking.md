**Clarity of visualizations:**
Both notebooks have clear visualizations without misleading displays.

**Confidence in creating visualizations:**
Notebook 1 provides more detailed code explanations that would help users create their own visualizations.

**Structure and complexity display:**
Both notebooks effectively show the data structure, with Notebook 2 providing an interesting dual-axis visualization.

**Clarity of interpretations:**
Neither notebook makes unsupported claims or interpretations.

**Redundancy:**
Neither notebook has unnecessarily repetitive content.

**Understanding future analyses:**
Notebook 1 provides more detailed suggestions for future analyses.

**Clarity and ease of following:**
