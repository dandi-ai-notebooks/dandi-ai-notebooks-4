    "image_descriptions": "# Image Descriptions\n\n## Image 1: Eye Tracking Data\n\n**Overview:**\nThe figure shows eye tracking data for the first 1000 points from the \"eye_tracking\" series. It consists of two subplots arranged vertically, sharing the same x-axis representing time in seconds. The top subplot shows the X-coordinate of eye position (in meters) plotted in blue, while the bottom subplot shows the Y-coordinate (in meters) plotted in red. Both traces show fluctuations in eye position over a period of approximately 15-30 seconds.\n\n**Minor issues:**\n- None observed. The figure is well-formatted with appropriate axis labels, title, and legend.\n\n**Major issues:**\n- There are several large spikes/drops in both X and Y coordinates (around 19-22 seconds) that might represent blinks or tracking artifacts rather than actual eye movements. These abrupt vertical lines that drop well below the main signal range could potentially be artifacts or moments when the tracking was momentarily lost.\n- These artifacts might need to be filtered out for proper analysis of eye movements.\n\n## Image 2: Running Speed\n\n**Overview:**\nThis figure displays the running speed of the animal (in cm/s) over time (in seconds) for the first 2000 data points. The speed is plotted as a green line against time. The plot shows periods of activity (positive speeds up to approximately 15 cm/s) interspersed with periods of inactivity (speeds close to zero).\n\n**Minor issues:**\n- None observed. The figure has appropriate axis labels, title, and legend.\n\n**Major issues:**\n- The running speed data includes negative values (down to approximately -10 cm/s), which suggests this may actually be velocity data rather than absolute speed. In a true speed measurement, values would typically be non-negative.\n- The presence of both positive and negative values suggests the animal might be running in two directions on a linear track or wheel, rather than an absolute speed measurement.\n- There are some extremely sharp transitions between high positive and negative values that might represent sudden changes in direction or potential artifacts in the speed calculation.\n\nBoth visualizations provide useful insights into the behavioral data available in this dataset, though a complete analysis would need to account for the potential artifacts noted above.",
