    "image_descriptions": "# Image Description Analysis\n\nThe notebook contains two data visualization images:\n\n## Image 1: Eye Tracking Data (First 1000 points of 'eye_tracking' series)\n\n### Overview\nThis figure shows eye tracking data from the mouse experiment, displaying the first 1000 data points across two subplots:\n- Top subplot (blue): X-coordinate position of the eye tracking in meters over time (seconds)\n- Bottom subplot (red): Y-coordinate position of the eye tracking in meters over time (seconds)\n\n### Minor Issues\n- No apparent minor issues - the figure has proper labels, titles, and units\n- Both plots share the x-axis which makes temporal comparison straightforward\n- Legend is provided for each subplot\n\n### Data Quality Assessment\n- The data appears legitimate with natural variations\n- There are several sharp dips/spikes in both X and Y coordinates (around 19.5s, 22s) which might represent:\n  * Eye blinks\n  * Saccades (rapid eye movements)\n  * Potential tracking artifacts\n- Between these events, there are periods of relative stability and smaller oscillations that likely represent normal eye movements or small fixational movements\n- The plotting range is appropriate to show the relevant data while including the full range of movements\n\n## Image 2: Running Speed (First 2000 points)\n\n### Overview\nThis figure displays the running speed of the mouse over time, showing the first 2000 data points collected:\n- Single plot showing speed in cm/s (y-axis) over time in seconds (x-axis)\n- Green line shows the running speed trajectory\n\n### Minor Issues\n- No apparent minor issues - the plot has clear labels and units\n\n### Data Quality Assessment\n- The data shows a mix of activity and inactivity periods:\n  * During ~120-145 seconds: Active running with speeds reaching ~15 cm/s\n  * After ~155 seconds: Mostly inactive with minimal movement\n- There are negative speed values, suggesting the data represents velocity rather than absolute speed (indicating direction of movement)\n- The pattern appears biologically plausible for a mouse on a running wheel or track\n- The data capture shows a natural transition from an active running period to a period of rest or minimal activity\n\nBoth visualizations provide meaningful insights into the behavioral data recorded alongside the neural activity in this experiment, showing time-synchronized measurements of eye movement and locomotion behavior.",
