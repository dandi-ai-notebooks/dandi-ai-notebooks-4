    "image_descriptions": "I can provide a detailed description of the two images shown in the notebook:\n\n### Image 1: Eye Tracking Data\nThis figure shows eye tracking data from the first 1000 data points of the 'eye_tracking' spatial series. It consists of two subplots:\n\n1. **Top subplot (blue)**: Shows the X-coordinate position of the eye in meters over time (seconds). The data shows fluctuations roughly around 340-370 meters with occasional sharp drops (at approximately 19 and 22 seconds) where the position briefly falls to around 280 meters.\n\n2. **Bottom subplot (red)**: Shows the Y-coordinate position of the eye in meters over time (seconds). The Y position fluctuates mostly around 240-260 meters with occasional spikes upward to approximately 280-290 meters.\n\nThe figure is well-formatted with proper axis labels, a title, and legends. Time is on the x-axis (in seconds) and coordinates on the y-axis (in meters). The sudden, extreme deviations in both X and Y coordinates at similar timepoints likely represent blinking events or tracking artifacts.\n\nNo major issues with this figure are evident - it appears to show reasonable eye position data with characteristic movements and potential blinks.\n\n### Image 2: Running Speed Data\nThis figure shows the running speed of the animal for the first 2000 data points of the recording. The data is plotted as a single green line showing speed (cm/s) over time (seconds).\n\nKey features:\n- The plot shows periods of activity (between approximately 120-150 seconds) where the speed fluctuates between -10 and +15 cm/s\n- After about 160 seconds, the animal appears to be mostly stationary with very minimal movement\n- The presence of both positive and negative values suggests this represents velocity (with direction) rather than absolute speed\n\nThe figure is well-formatted with proper axis labels, title, and legend. The y-axis appropriately shows speed in cm/s, and the x-axis shows time in seconds.\n\nNo major issues with this figure are evident - it appears to show typical running behavior with periods of activity followed by relative inactivity.",

    "thinking": "Let me evaluate this notebook against each criterion:\n\n1. The notebook contains a description of the dandiset: PASS - The notebook includes a detailed description of the Dandiset 000690 (Allen Institute Openscope - Vision2Hippocampus project), including its purpose and the types of stimuli presented.\n\n2. The notebook shows how to use the DANDI API to access metadata and list files: FAIL - There is an error in this section. The code tries to access `asset.asset_id` but encounters an error: \"Error connecting to DANDI or fetching Dandiset info: 'RemoteBlobAsset' object has no attribute 'asset_id'\". The attempt to list assets fails.\n\n3. The notebook shows how to access metadata for an NWB file: PASS - The notebook successfully loads and displays metadata from a specific NWB file, showing session description, identifier, start time, subject ID, and institution.\n\n4. The notebook shows how to visualize data from an NWB file: PASS - The notebook visualizes both eye tracking data and running speed data from the NWB file.\n\n5. No major issues with plots: PASS - Both the eye tracking and running speed visualizations are informative and properly display the data with appropriate axes labels and titles.\n\n6. No unsupported interpretations: PASS - The interpretations of the data (e.g., about eye tracking movements and running behavior) are reasonable and supported by the visualizations.\n\n7. Output cells present where expected: PASS - Output cells are present throughout the notebook where expected.\n\n8. No fake/simulated data: PASS - The notebook uses actual data from the dandiset, not simulated data.\n\n9. No major execution errors: MIXED - There are two notable errors:\n   - The DANDI API asset listing failed\n   - When trying to display the units table preview, there's an error: \"Could not display units table preview: DynamicTable.to_dataframe: incorrect type for 'index' (got 'list', expected 'bool')\"\n   \n   While these aren't catastrophic, the DANDI API issue means criterion #2 is failed.\n\n10. No other major problems: PASS - The notebook is well-structured and educational despite the issues mentioned.\n\nDue to the failure to properly list assets using the DANDI API (criterion #2), I must fail this notebook. This is a fundamental feature that should work in an introductory notebook to a dandiset.",
