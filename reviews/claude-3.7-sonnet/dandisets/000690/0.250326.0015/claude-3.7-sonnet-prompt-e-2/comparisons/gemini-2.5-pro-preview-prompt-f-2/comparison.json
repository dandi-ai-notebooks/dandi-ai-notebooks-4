They both address most of the criteria specified for a good notebook.\n\nNotebook 1 provides more comprehensive coverage of the different data types in the Dandiset and includes more advanced visualizations that show relationships between different aspects of the data (e.g., neural activity with behavior, neural activity with stimuli). It explores more data types (LFP data, stimulus features, more detailed eye tracking) and provides deeper analysis examples.\n\nNotebook 2 has a cleaner structure with a clear outline of what it covers and better error handling in the code. It also includes a useful link to Neurosift for interactive exploration and properly closes file resources. However, it covers fewer data types and has fewer advanced visualizations.\n\nIn terms of helping a user understand the Dandiset, Notebook 1 provides a more comprehensive introduction to the data and shows more examples of what can be done with it. While Notebook 2 is well-structured, it doesn't explore the data as deeply.\n\nFor a starting point for exploring the Dandiset, Notebook 1 offers more value in terms of showcasing the richness of the data and potential analyses, despite being slightly less structured than Notebook 2.\n\n### Decision\n\nBased on the criteria focusing on helping users explore the Dandiset and understand the different types of data available, I believe Notebook 1 is better. It provides more comprehensive coverage of the data types, more visualizations that help understand the data structure, and more examples of potential analyses that could be done with the Dandiset.",
