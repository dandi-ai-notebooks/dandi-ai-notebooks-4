I'll evaluate both notebooks based on the provided criteria and determine which one better serves as a starting point for exploring Dandiset 000690.

### Notebook 1 Assessment

**Strengths:**
- Has a clear title that includes the Dandiset name
- Includes an AI-generated content warning at the beginning
- Provides an overview of the Dandiset with a link to the archive
- Lists required packages
- Shows how to access the Dandiset using the DANDI API
- Loads an NWB file and displays metadata
- Explores multiple aspects of the data structure (acquisition data, processing modules, intervals, electrode groups)
- Provides in-depth visualizations of different data types:
  - Unit firing rates histogram
  - Visual stimulus frames
  - LFP data traces and spectrogram
  - Spike raster plots aligned with stimulus presentation
  - Eye tracking data (pupil position and blinks)
  - Running wheel data
  - Neural-behavioral correlations
- Includes explanatory markdown cells that guide through the analysis process
- Has a comprehensive summary and future directions section
- Demonstrates more advanced visualizations that correlate different types of data (neural activity with behavior)

**Weaknesses:**
- Some visualizations might be a bit complex for beginners
- A more explicit outline of what the notebook covers would be helpful

### Notebook 2 Assessment

**Strengths:**
- Has a clear title that includes the Dandiset name
- Includes an AI-generated content warning
- Provides a link to the Dandiset
- Lists required packages
- Shows how to access the Dandiset using the DANDI API
- Loads an NWB file and displays metadata
- Has an explicit outline of what the notebook covers
- Explores the structure of the NWB file
- Provides visualizations of different data types (eye tracking, running speed, neural spike raster)
- Includes a link to Neurosift for interactive exploration
- Has a summary and future directions section
- Properly closes file resources at the end
- Good error handling in the code

**Weaknesses:**
- Visualizations are more basic compared to Notebook 1
- Fewer data types are explored and visualized
- Less depth in correlating different types of data
- Fewer advanced analysis examples

### Comparison

Both notebooks do a good job of introducing the Dandiset and showing how to work with the data. They both address most of the criteria specified for a good notebook.

Notebook 1 provides more comprehensive coverage of the different data types in the Dandiset and includes more advanced visualizations that show relationships between different aspects of the data (e.g., neural activity with behavior, neural activity with stimuli). It explores more data types (LFP data, stimulus features, more detailed eye tracking) and provides deeper analysis examples.

Notebook 2 has a cleaner structure with a clear outline of what it covers and better error handling in the code. It also includes a useful link to Neurosift for interactive exploration and properly closes file resources. However, it covers fewer data types and has fewer advanced visualizations.

In terms of helping a user understand the Dandiset, Notebook 1 provides a more comprehensive introduction to the data and shows more examples of what can be done with it. While Notebook 2 is well-structured, it doesn't explore the data as deeply.

For a starting point for exploring the Dandiset, Notebook 1 offers more value in terms of showcasing the richness of the data and potential analyses, despite being slightly less structured than Notebook 2.

### Decision

Based on the criteria focusing on helping users explore the Dandiset and understand the different types of data available, I believe Notebook 1 is better. It provides more comprehensive coverage of the data types, more visualizations that help understand the data structure, and more examples of potential analyses that could be done with the Dandiset.
