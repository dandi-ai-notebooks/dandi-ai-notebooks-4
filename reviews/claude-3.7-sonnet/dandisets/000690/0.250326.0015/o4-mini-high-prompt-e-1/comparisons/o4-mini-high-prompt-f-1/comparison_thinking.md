Let me compare the two notebooks based on the criteria provided:

1. **Title including Dandiset name**: Both notebooks have the same title "Exploring Dandiset 000690: Allen Institute Openscope - Vision2Hippocampus project" ✓

2. **AI-generated warning**: Both notebooks include this warning at the top ✓

3. **Overview of Dandiset**: 
   - Notebook 1 provides a more detailed overview including the Dandiset URL, version, and a clear bulleted list of what the notebook will cover
   - Notebook 2 has a more brief overview with less specific details about what will be covered

4. **Required packages**:
   - Notebook 1 includes code cell importing all packages and setting up visualization preferences
   - Notebook 2 lists required packages in a markdown cell but doesn't show all imports in one place

5. **Loading Dandiset via DANDI API**:
   - Both notebooks demonstrate this well with similar code

6. **Loading NWB file and metadata**:
   - Both notebooks load the same NWB file
   - Notebook 1 shows the identifier but Notebook 2 shows more metadata (session description, identifier, start time)

7. **Description of available data**:
   - Notebook 1 provides a more comprehensive and organized overview of the NWB file structure
   - Notebook 1 shows more details about intervals, electrode groups, devices, units columns, and subject data

8. **Loading and visualizing data**:
   - Notebook 1 demonstrates more types of visualizations (eye tracking position over time, running speed over time)
   - Notebook 2 only shows eye tracking positions as a scatter plot

9. **Advanced visualization**:
   - Notebook 1 includes a more advanced visualization combining eye position with running speed
   - Notebook 2 does have a color-coded scatter plot but it's just coloring by time, not incorporating another data type

10. **Summary and future directions**:
    - Both notebooks include this section with reasonable suggestions

11. **Explanatory markdown**:
    - Both notebooks use markdown cells effectively to guide the user

12. **Code documentation**:
    - Both notebooks have decent documentation, but Notebook 1 has more thorough comments

13. **Focus on basics**:
    - Both notebooks avoid overanalysis and focus on fundamentals

14. **Visualization clarity**:
    - Notebook 1's visualizations have better labels, titles, and formatting overall
    - Notebook 1 shows both time series and spatial visualizations, giving users a better understanding of the data

15. **Reusable code**:
    - Both notebooks provide reusable code examples

Overall, Notebook 1 appears more comprehensive and detailed. It:
- Provides better structure for the NWB file overview
- Shows multiple visualization types (time series and spatial)
- Includes a more advanced combined visualization
- Has clearer formatting and more thorough documentation
- Shows more types of data (both eye tracking and running speed)

While Notebook 2 is still good, it's more limited in scope, showing only eye tracking data with a single visualization type.
