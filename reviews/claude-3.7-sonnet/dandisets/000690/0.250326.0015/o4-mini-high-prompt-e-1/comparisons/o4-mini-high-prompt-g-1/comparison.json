It provides a more comprehensive introduction to the dataset with better error handling, and focuses on neural data (LFP) which is the primary focus of this neuroscience dataset. The LFP visualizations with spectrogram are relevant for understanding brain activity patterns. Additionally, the tabular display of electrode metadata provides important context for understanding the recording locations. The more detailed dataset description helps users better understand the experimental design and purpose.\n\nHowever, both notebooks are very good, and Notebook 1's focus on behavioral measures and the combined visualization is also valuable.",
