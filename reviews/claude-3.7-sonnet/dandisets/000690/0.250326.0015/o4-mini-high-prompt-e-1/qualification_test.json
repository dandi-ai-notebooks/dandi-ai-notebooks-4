    "image_descriptions": "# Description of Images in the Notebook\n\n## Figure 1: Eye Tracking Position (First 1000 samples)\n\n**Overview:**\nThis figure displays eye tracking data over time, showing X position (blue line) and Y position (orange line) of the eye during the first 1000 samples. The X-axis represents time in seconds (ranging from approximately 15 to 31 seconds), and the Y-axis shows the eye position in meters.\n\n**Minor issues:**\n- No obvious formatting issues\n- Axes are properly labeled\n- Legend is clear\n\n**Major issues:**\n- None apparent. The data appears valid, showing natural eye movement patterns with some small fluctuations and occasional larger movements.\n\n## Figure 2: Running Speed (First 1000 samples)\n\n**Overview:**\nThis figure shows the animal's running speed over time for the first 1000 samples. The X-axis represents time in seconds (ranging from approximately 112 to 138 seconds), and the Y-axis shows speed in cm/s. The data is plotted as a green line.\n\n**Minor issues:**\n- The time range (112-138s) is different from the eye tracking figure (15-31s), suggesting the data may not be synchronized in this visualization.\n\n**Major issues:**\n- None apparent. The data shows periods of inactivity (zero speed) interspersed with running bouts, which is a typical pattern for mice on running wheels.\n\n## Figure 3: Eye Position with Running Speed\n\n**Overview:**\nThis is a scatter plot showing the eye position in 2D space (X and Y coordinates), with points colored according to running speed. The color bar on the right indicates the running speed in cm/s, with brighter yellow/green colors representing faster running and darker blue/purple colors representing slower speeds or negative values.\n\n**Minor issues:**\n- The figure is somewhat small (4x4 size) which limits detailed inspection\n- The units for eye position (meters) seem unusually large (values around 250-350m), which may be a unit conversion error\n\n**Major issues:**\n- There appears to be an outlier point near coordinates (300, 215) that is far from the main cluster of eye positions\n- The eye position data appears to be concentrated in a small region, suggesting either limited eye movement during recording or potentially some calibration issue\n- The negative running speed values in the color bar are unexpected and might indicate an issue with the speed calculation (running speed should generally be positive or zero)\n\nOverall, the figures effectively visualize the basic temporal and spatial patterns in the eye tracking and running speed data, but there are some inconsistencies in the units and synchronization that would need to be addressed for more rigorous analysis.",
