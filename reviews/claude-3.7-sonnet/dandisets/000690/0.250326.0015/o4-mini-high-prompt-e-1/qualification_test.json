    "image_descriptions": "I'll provide detailed descriptions of each figure in the notebook:\n\n### Figure 1: Eye Tracking Position (First 1000 samples)\n**Overview:**\n- This figure displays eye tracking position data for the first 1000 samples from the NWB file.\n- It shows two time series: X position (blue line) and Y position (orange line) of the eye over time.\n- The x-axis represents time in seconds (ranging from about 15 to 30 seconds).\n- The y-axis represents position in meters (ranging from approximately 220 to 370 meters).\n\n**Minor issues:**\n- The y-axis values seem unusually large for eye position (200-350 meters), suggesting these might be in different units than what's labeled or possibly raw pixel values that need conversion.\n- The plot could benefit from grid lines to make it easier to read specific values.\n\n**Major issues:**\n- No major issues with the visualization itself, though the unusual scale of position values suggests possible unit conversion needed.\n\n### Figure 2: Running Speed (First 1000 samples)\n**Overview:**\n- This figure shows running speed data for the first 1000 samples from the NWB file.\n- The green line represents the animal's running speed over time.\n- The x-axis represents time in seconds (ranging from about 110 to 137 seconds).\n- The y-axis shows speed in cm/s (ranging from about -10 to 15 cm/s).\n\n**Minor issues:**\n- The time range displayed (110-137 seconds) is different from the eye tracking data (15-30 seconds), making direct comparison between the plots difficult.\n- Negative speed values might represent backward movement or could be an artifact of how speed is calculated.\n\n**Major issues:**\n- No major issues with the visualization itself.\n\n### Figure 3: Eye Position with Running Speed\n**Overview:**\n- This figure shows a scatter plot of eye position where:\n  - X-axis represents eye X position (in meters)\n  - Y-axis represents eye Y position (in meters)\n  - Points are color-coded according to the running speed (cm/s) at that moment\n  - A color bar on the right indicates the speed scale from approximately -10 to 15 cm/s\n\n**Minor issues:**\n- The axes are somewhat tight to the data, and the aspect ratio makes the distribution appear more compressed in the x-direction.\n- There's an outlier point far from the main cluster (around x=300, y=220m) that could benefit from investigation.\n\n**Major issues:**\n- The eye position values (ranging from ~220-300m) remain unusually large, suggesting a unit conversion issue.\n- Since the timeframes differ between the eye tracking and running speed data (as seen in the previous two plots), the correspondence between eye position and running speed might not be temporally aligned correctly.\n\nOverall, the visualizations effectively show the data patterns, but there are questions about the units of eye position and the temporal alignment between datasets that should be addressed for more accurate analysis.",
