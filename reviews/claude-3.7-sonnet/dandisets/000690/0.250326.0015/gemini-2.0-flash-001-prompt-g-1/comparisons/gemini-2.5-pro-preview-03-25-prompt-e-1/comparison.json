    "thinking": "Let me compare these two notebooks according to the criteria provided.\n\n## Title and Disclaimer\n- **Notebook 1**: Has a clear title \"Exploring Dandiset 000690: Vision2Hippocampus Project\" and includes the disclaimer about being AI-generated.\n- **Notebook 2**: Has a similar title \"Exploring Dandiset 000690: Allen Institute Openscope - Vision2Hippocampus project\" and also includes the AI-generated disclaimer.\nBoth are comparable in this aspect.\n\n## Overview of the Dandiset\n- **Notebook 1**: Provides a brief overview and includes a link to the Dandiset on DANDI.\n- **Notebook 2**: Provides a more comprehensive overview, including a detailed description from the Dandiset itself about stimulus presentation, and properly cites the dataset with authors. The link to DANDI is also provided.\nNotebook 2 is better in this category.\n\n## Summary of What the Notebook Will Cover\n- **Notebook 1**: Lists 6 points that will be covered, clearly organized.\n- **Notebook 2**: Also provides a clear list of 8 points that will be covered.\nBoth are good, with Notebook 2 being slightly more comprehensive.\n\n## Required Packages\n- **Notebook 1**: Lists required packages in a markdown cell.\n- **Notebook 2**: Lists required packages and includes explanations for their purposes.\nNotebook 2 is slightly better here.\n\n## Loading the Dandiset using the DANDI API\n- **Notebook 1**: Shows how to connect to the DANDI API and prints basic information.\n- **Notebook 2**: Does the same but also prints a more comprehensive description of the Dandiset.\nBoth accomplish the task, with Notebook 2 providing more context.\n\n## Loading NWB File and Showing Metadata\n- **Notebook 1**: Loads an NWB file and displays the metadata in a raw format.\n- **Notebook 2**: Loads an NWB file and formats the output in a more organized way.\nBoth accomplish this task effectively.\n\n## Description of Available Data in NWB File\n- **Notebook 1**: Provides a hierarchical tree-like structure of the NWB file contents, which is very helpful.\n- **Notebook 2**: Provides a summary of key data groups with more detail about what each contains.\nNotebook 1 gives a better visual representation of the structure, while Notebook 2 provides more detailed descriptions.\n\n## Loading and Visualizing Different Types of Data\n- **Notebook 1**: Shows how to load and visualize eye tracking data and running speed.\n- **Notebook 2**: Shows how to load and visualize running speed, pupil area, and spike times for a single unit, as well as stimulus presentation times. It also includes more error handling and better documentation.\nNotebook 2 demonstrates more types of data visualization and has better code quality.\n\n## Advanced Visualization\n- **Notebook 1**: Attempts to load and visualize LFP data but fails due to limitations in the data access.\n- **Notebook 2**: Successfully visualizes multiple types of data, including a spike raster plot and stimulus presentation times.\nNotebook 2 is more successful in showing advanced visualizations.\n\n## Summary and Future Directions\n- **Notebook 1**: Briefly mentions potential future analyses.\n- **Notebook 2**: Provides a more detailed summary of what was demonstrated and offers comprehensive suggestions for future directions, organized by area of analysis.\nNotebook 2's summary is more thorough and potentially more useful for users.\n\n## Explanatory Markdown Cells\n- **Notebook 1**: Has good explanatory markdown cells throughout.\n- **Notebook 2**: Also has good explanatory cells, with perhaps a bit more detail.\nBoth do well here.\n\n## Documentation and Best Practices\n- **Notebook 1**: Code is generally well-documented but has less error handling.\n- **Notebook 2**: Code is well-documented with more comprehensive error handling, which is important for working with complex data formats like NWB.\nNotebook 2 follows better practices.\n\n## Focus on Basics\n- **Notebook 1**: Stays focused on the basics without overinterpretation.\n- **Notebook 2**: Also stays focused on the basics and provides clear explanations without overinterpretation.\nBoth do well here.\n\n## Visualization Quality\n- **Notebook 1**: Visualizations are clear but limited in number.\n- **Notebook 2**: Provides more visualizations that are clearly labeled and formatted.\nNotebook 2 has a slight edge.\n\n## Code Quality and Reusability\n- **Notebook 1**: Code is straightforward but has less error handling.\n- **Notebook 2**: Code includes thorough error checking, useful comments, and proper cleanup at the end which makes it more robust and reusable.\nNotebook 2 has better code quality.\n\n## Additional Features\n- Notebook 2 includes a link to explore the NWB file on Neurosift, which is a nice touch for users wanting to explore interactively.\n- Notebook 2 includes proper resource cleanup at the end, which is an important best practice when working with large files.\n\n## Summary\nNotebook 2 is generally more comprehensive, has better code quality with proper error handling, provides more visualizations, gives a more detailed overview of the dataset, and offers more thorough explanations of future directions. While both notebooks accomplish the basic task of introducing users to the Dandiset, Notebook 2 does so more effectively and would likely be more helpful for users looking to explore this data.\n\nThe selection is 2 (Notebook 2 is better).",
