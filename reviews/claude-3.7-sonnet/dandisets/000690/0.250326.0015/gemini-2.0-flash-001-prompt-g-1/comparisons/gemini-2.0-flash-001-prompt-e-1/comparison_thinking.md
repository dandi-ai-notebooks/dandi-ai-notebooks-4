I'll analyze both notebooks against the criteria provided:

### Basic Requirements

Both notebooks include:
- A title with the Dandiset name
- A disclaimer about AI generation
- A link to the Dandiset
- Required packages
- Instructions for loading the Dandiset using the DANDI API
- Code for loading an NWB file
- Some data visualization

### Detailed Comparison

#### Overview and Structure
- **Notebook 1** provides a more comprehensive overview of the Dandiset's purpose, explaining it explores "how neural representations of simple and natural stimuli evolve from the LGN through V1, and most hippocampal regions."
- **Notebook 1** has a clearer structure with well-defined sections and a table of contents-like section ("What This Notebook Will Cover")
- **Notebook 2** has a briefer overview and less clearly defined structure

#### NWB File Structure Description
- **Notebook 1** has a detailed breakdown of the NWB file structure in a clear hierarchical format
- **Notebook 1** includes a link to Neurosift for further exploration
- **Notebook 2** includes a Neurosift link but provides less detail about the file structure

#### Data Visualization
- **Notebook 1** includes multiple visualizations:
  - Eye tracking data
  - Running speed data
  - Attempted to visualize neural data (though it encountered an issue with loading LFP data)
- **Notebook 2** includes only one visualization:
  - LFP data from a single probe

#### Explanatory Text and Documentation
- **Notebook 1** has more thorough explanations throughout, explaining what the data represent and how they might be interpreted
- **Notebook 2** has shorter explanations and less context for understanding the data

#### Future Directions and Summary
- **Notebook 1** includes a section on future analysis directions and summarizes the findings
- **Notebook 2** does not include a summary or future directions section

### Specific Strengths of Notebook 1
1. More comprehensive overview of the Dandiset
2. Better organization and structure
3. Multiple data visualizations showing different aspects of the data
4. Clearer explanations of the data types and their significance
5. Detailed breakdown of the NWB file structure
6. Summary and future directions section

### Specific Strengths of Notebook 2
1. Successfully visualizes LFP data (where Notebook 1 failed)
2. More concise overall

### Decision
Notebook 1 is clearly superior in most aspects. It provides a more comprehensive introduction to the Dandiset, better explains the data structure, offers multiple visualizations, and includes useful supplementary information like future directions. The only advantage Notebook 2 has is that it successfully visualizes LFP data where Notebook 1 encounters an issue. However, this single advantage doesn't outweigh the numerous strengths of Notebook 1.
