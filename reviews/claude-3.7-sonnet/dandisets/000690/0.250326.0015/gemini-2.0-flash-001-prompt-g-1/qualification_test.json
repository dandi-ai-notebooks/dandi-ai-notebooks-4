The plot displays approximately 15 seconds of eye tracking data (from about 15s to 30s). The X position remains relatively stable around 380 pixels with some minor fluctuations, while the Y position hovers around 220 pixels.\n\n### Minor Issues\n- No obvious formatting issues - the plot has proper axis labels, a title, and a legend.\n- The grid lines and overall styling are appropriate for data visualization.\n\n### Major Issues\n- There appears to be a sudden spike in both X and Y positions at around 22.5 seconds. This could be either an eye movement/blink or potentially a tracking artifact. Without more context or additional metrics (like blink detection), it's difficult to determine if this is a valid data point or noise.\n- The plot only shows the first 1000 timepoints, which is just a small subset of the overall recording. This limitation was explicitly mentioned in the code to improve plotting speed.\n\n## Image 2: Running Speed Over Time\n\n### Overview\nThis figure displays the animal's running speed in centimeters per second over time (approximately from 113s to 138s). The data shows intervals of running interspersed with periods of rest or minimal movement (speed near zero).\n\n### Minor Issues\n- No obvious formatting issues - the plot has proper axis labels, a title, and appropriate scaling.\n\n### Major Issues\n- The running speed data contains negative values (dropping as low as -10 cm/s at some points), which is physically counterintuitive since speed is typically a positive quantity. This was acknowledged in the notebook as potentially being due to sensor properties. These negative values might represent:\n  - Backward movements\n  - Calibration issues\n  - Sensor artifacts or noise\n  - Signal processing artifacts from how the wheel rotation is converted to speed\n- The data shows high variability with rapid fluctuations between positive and negative speeds, which could be a result of jittery movements or sensor sensitivity.\n- Like the previous plot, this visualization only shows the first 1000 timepoints of data, which is a subset of the full recording.\n\nThe third image that was supposed to show neural data (LFP) from probeA did not render because the code was unable to locate the LFP ElectricalSeries for the selected electrodes. The code instead printed a message indicating this could be due to the notebook only loading metadata and excluding the raw data.",
