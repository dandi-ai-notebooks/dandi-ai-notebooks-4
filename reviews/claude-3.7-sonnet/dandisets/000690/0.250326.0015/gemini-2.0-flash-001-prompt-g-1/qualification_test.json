    "image_descriptions": "I'll provide a detailed description of the two figures in the notebook:\n\n### Figure 1: Eye Tracking Position Over Time\n\n**Overview:**\nThis figure shows eye tracking position data over time, plotting both X and Y coordinates of pupil position in pixels. The blue line represents X position, and the orange line represents Y position. The data spans approximately 15-30 seconds of recording time. The pupil position appears relatively stable with some minor movements and one notable spike around the 22.5 second mark.\n\n**Minor Issues:**\n- No significant formatting issues - the figure has proper axis labels, a title, and legend.\n- The time window is limited to 1000 data points as noted in the code, which is reasonable for visualization purposes.\n\n**Major Issues:**\n- No major issues with the visualization itself.\n- It would be helpful to include some context about the coordinate system (what do the pixel values mean in terms of eye position) and what events might correlate with the spike in eye position around 22.5 seconds.\n\n### Figure 2: Running Speed Over Time\n\n**Overview:**\nThis figure displays the animal's running speed in centimeters per second over a time period of approximately 113-137 seconds. The data shows variable running behavior with periods of no movement (speed near zero) and several bouts of running with speeds reaching up to about 15 cm/s at peak.\n\n**Minor Issues:**\n- The figure has appropriate axes labels, title, and scaling.\n- As with the eye tracking data, only 1000 data points are shown for visualization purposes.\n\n**Major Issues:**\n- The running speed occasionally shows negative values (as low as -10 cm/s), which is physically impossible for actual forward/backward movement. This was acknowledged in the markdown text preceding the figure as potentially being due to sensor properties. This could reflect limitations in how running speed is calculated from the raw wheel rotation data, perhaps without proper calibration or filtering.\n- It would be helpful to include information about how these negative values should be interpreted or handled in analyses.\n\nBoth visualizations successfully demonstrate the types of behavioral data available in this Dandiset. The notebook appropriately mentions the relationship between these behavioral metrics and neural data as a potential direction for future analysis.",
