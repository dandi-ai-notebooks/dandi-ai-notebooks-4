    "image_descriptions": "I'll provide detailed descriptions of the two figures shown in the notebook:\n\n### Figure 1: \"First 3 Channels of LFP Data (Offset for Clarity)\"\n\n**Overview:**\nThis figure shows the first 10,000 samples of Local Field Potential (LFP) recordings from three channels, displayed with vertical offsets to make them visually distinct. Each channel is represented by a different color line (blue for channel 0, orange for channel 1, and green for channel 2). The x-axis shows time in seconds (ranging from approximately 20-28 seconds), and the y-axis shows voltage in volts.\n\n**Minor issues:**\n- The vertical offset applied (0.005V between channels) makes the absolute voltage values somewhat difficult to interpret directly.\n- The plot shows relatively stable oscillatory activity, but the specific frequency bands of interest are not highlighted.\n\n**Major issues:**\n- No major issues are apparent. The figure clearly shows the requested data with proper labeling and formatting.\n\n### Figure 2: \"Spectrogram of LFP Channel 0\"\n\n**Overview:**\nThis figure shows a spectrogram of LFP channel 0, which visualizes how the power of different frequency components varies over time. The x-axis represents time in seconds (0-7 seconds), the y-axis shows frequency in Hz (0-600 Hz), and the color scale indicates power (with brighter yellow colors representing higher power and darker purple representing lower power).\n\n**Minor issues:**\n- The power scale appears to be in logarithmic units (likely dB) but isn't explicitly labeled as such. The colorbar shows negative values.\n- The spectrogram shows higher power in the low-frequency bands (0-100 Hz), which is typical for LFP data, but might benefit from a logarithmic frequency scale to better visualize these bands.\n\n**Major issues:**\n- No major issues are apparent. The spectrogram is properly implemented with appropriate NFFT and overlap parameters.\n\nBoth figures effectively visualize the LFP data, with the first showing temporal dynamics and the second showing frequency content. The plots use appropriate styling with a clean Seaborn theme and have complete axis labels and titles.",
