### Decision

Notebook 1 is better overall because:
1. It provides more detailed information about the Dandiset
2. It includes more comprehensive exploration of the NWB file structure
3. It has more diverse visualizations, including both raw LFP data and a spectrogram
4. It includes better error handling in the code
5. It provides a more thorough explanation of available data types
6. It demonstrates more visualization techniques that would help users create their own visualizations

While both notebooks are well-structured and clear, Notebook 1 goes further in helping the user understand and explore the Dandiset, providing stronger foundations for future analysis.
