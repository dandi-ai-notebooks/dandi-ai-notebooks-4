It provides more detailed information about the Dandiset\n2. It includes more comprehensive exploration of the NWB file structure\n3. It has more diverse visualizations, including both raw LFP data and a spectrogram\n4. It includes better error handling in the code\n5. It provides a more thorough explanation of available data types\n6. It demonstrates more visualization techniques that would help users create their own visualizations\n\nWhile both notebooks are well-structured and clear, Notebook 1 goes further in helping the user understand and explore the Dandiset, providing stronger foundations for future analysis.",
