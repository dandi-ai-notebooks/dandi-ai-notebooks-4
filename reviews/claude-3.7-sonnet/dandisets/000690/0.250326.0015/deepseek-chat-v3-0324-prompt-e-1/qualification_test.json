    "image_descriptions": "Based on the notebook, there would be two figures that should be generated, although I don't see the actual output figures in the input you provided. I'll describe what each figure would show based on the code:\n\n### Figure 1: Electrode Positions in Brain\n\n**Overview:**\n- This figure would be a scatter plot showing the spatial positions of the electrodes from the Neuropixels probe in 3D brain space.\n- The x-axis represents the \"Y coordinate\" (inferior direction), the y-axis represents the \"Z coordinate\" (right direction).\n- The color of each point (using the viridis colormap) represents the \"X coordinate\" (posterior direction).\n- A colorbar on the right would indicate the X coordinate values.\n\n**Minor Issues:**\n- The axis labels are somewhat ambiguous (\"Y (inferior)\" and \"Z (right)\") and could benefit from clearer anatomical reference.\n- The plot lacks grid lines which might help with spatial interpretation.\n- There's no scale information to understand the actual distances between electrodes.\n\n**Potential Major Issues:**\n- Without seeing the actual output, it's difficult to determine if the electrode positions make anatomical sense for a Neuropixels probe, which typically spans multiple brain regions in a linear arrangement.\n- If the scatter points appear randomly distributed rather than in a linear or organized pattern, it might indicate coordinate system issues.\n\n### Figure 2: LFP Traces\n\n**Overview:**\n- This figure would display LFP (Local Field Potential) traces for 10 selected channels over a 60-second period.\n- The channels are selected at regular intervals (every 10th channel from the 95 total).\n- Each trace is vertically offset for better visualization.\n- Channel numbers and anatomical locations are included in the legend.\n- The x-axis represents time in seconds, and the y-axis shows voltage with artificial offsets.\n\n**Minor Issues:**\n- The y-axis label \"Voltage (offset)\" doesn't specify the unit (likely microvolts).\n- With 10 traces, the legend might become quite large and potentially overlap with the plot.\n- No scale bar is provided to indicate the actual voltage amplitude.\n\n**Potential Major Issues:**\n- Without seeing the actual output, it's unclear if the LFP data shows reasonable electrophysiological signals or contains artifacts.\n- The selected 60-second segment from the middle of the recording is somewhat arbitrary and might not capture important neural events.\n- If all traces appeared completely flat or extremely noisy, this would indicate data loading issues or preprocessing problems.\n\nIf you can share the actual rendered outputs of these figures, I could provide more specific feedback about the quality and interpretability of the visualized data.",
