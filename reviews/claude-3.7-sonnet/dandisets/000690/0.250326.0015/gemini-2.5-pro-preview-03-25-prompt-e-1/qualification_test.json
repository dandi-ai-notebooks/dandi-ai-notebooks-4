    "image_descriptions": "# Description of Images in the Notebook\n\nThere are four figures in the notebook, each visualizing different aspects of the NWB file data from Dandiset 000690:\n\n## Figure 1: Running Speed Plot\n- **Overview**: This figure shows the animal's running speed over time for the first 10,000 data points. The x-axis represents time in seconds (from approximately 100 to 600 seconds), and the y-axis shows running speed in cm/s, ranging from about -10 to +15 cm/s.\n- **Observations**: The data shows several distinct periods of increased activity (running) separated by periods of relative inactivity. The running episodes show both positive and negative values, suggesting the animal moved in both forward and backward directions on the running wheel.\n- **Minor issues**: None - the plot has appropriate labels, a clear title, and the data visualization is effective.\n- **Major issues**: None - the data appears to be valid running speed measurements with expected patterns of activity.\n\n## Figure 2: Pupil Area Plot\n- **Overview**: This figure displays pupil area measurements over the first 10,000 data points. The x-axis shows time in seconds (from approximately 25 to 175 seconds), and the y-axis shows pupil area (in the unit \"meters\" according to the label, though this might need interpretation).\n- **Observations**: The pupil area shows a baseline near zero with several dramatic spikes reaching values of 200,000-500,000. These spikes likely represent dilation events or possibly artifact measurements.\n- **Minor issues**: The y-axis unit is labeled as \"meters\" which seems unusual for pupil area (typically would be mm\u00b2 or pixels\u00b2). The notebook acknowledges this issue, noting that \"The unit for pupil area might need careful interpretation.\"\n- **Major issues**: None that prevent interpretation, though the absolute scale values are very large which suggests they might be in unusual units or represent raw detector values rather than calibrated measurements.\n\n## Figure 3: Spike Raster Plot\n- **Overview**: This figure shows a spike raster plot for neural unit ID 12 (marked as \"good\" quality) over the first 100 seconds of recording. Each vertical line represents the time of a neuronal action potential (spike).\n- **Observations**: The neuron appears to fire in clusters or bursts, with periods of activity around 20-30 seconds, 50-60 seconds, and 80-90 seconds. This suggests the neuron might respond to specific stimuli or behaviors that occur at these times.\n- **Minor issues**: None - the plot effectively shows the spike timing data.\n- **Major issues**: None - the data appears to show valid neuronal spiking patterns.\n\n## Figure 4: Stimulus Start Times Plot\n- **Overview**: This figure shows the start times for the first 50 presentations of the \"SAC_Wd15_Vel2_Bndry1_Cntst0_loop\" stimulus. The x-axis shows time in seconds (from approximately 113.1 to 113.9), and blue dots represent each stimulus onset.\n- **Observations**: The stimulus presentations occur at regular intervals (appear to be roughly every 16-17 milliseconds), suggesting this might be a frame-by-frame stimulus presented at around 60 Hz.\n- **Minor issues**: None - the plot clearly shows the temporal pattern of stimulus presentations.\n- **Major issues**: None - the data shows a reasonable temporal sequence for visual stimulus presentations.\n\nOverall, all four figures effectively visualize different aspects of the dataset, showing neural activity, behavioral measures, and stimulus timing information that could be used for further analysis.",
