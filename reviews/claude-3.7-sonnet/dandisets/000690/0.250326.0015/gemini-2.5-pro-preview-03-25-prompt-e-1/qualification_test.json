    "image_descriptions": "I'll provide a detailed description of each image in the notebook:\n\n### Image 1: Running Speed (First 10000 points)\n**Overview:**\nThis figure shows the running speed of the animal over time (approximately 600 seconds). The y-axis shows running speed measured in cm/s, ranging from about -10 to 15 cm/s. The x-axis shows time in seconds. The data shows several distinct periods of activity (higher running speeds) interspersed with periods of relative inactivity (speeds close to zero).\n\n**Minor Issues:**\n- None apparent; the figure is well-formatted with clear axis labels and title.\n\n**Major Issues:**\n- None. The figure effectively displays the running speed data. The occasional negative values might represent measurement noise or possibly the direction of running (backward vs. forward), which is typical in this type of data.\n\n### Image 2: Pupil Area (First 10000 points)\n**Overview:**\nThis figure shows the tracked pupil area over time (approximately 175 seconds). The y-axis shows pupil area measured in \"meters\" (though as noted in the code comments, this might require careful interpretation as it could be m\u00b2, pixels\u00b2, or another unit). The pupil area mostly stays close to baseline with several large spikes where the area increases dramatically.\n\n**Minor Issues:**\n- The y-axis scale is very large (0 to 800,000), with most data points clustered near zero, making the baseline difficult to see clearly.\n- As noted in the code output, the units for pupil area need careful interpretation.\n\n**Major Issues:**\n- The extreme spikes in pupil area (up to ~500,000) appear unusually large and might represent outliers or artifacts in the eye tracking, rather than physiological dilation.\n\n### Image 3: Spike Raster for Unit ID 12 (First 100 seconds)\n**Overview:**\nThis figure shows a spike raster plot for a single neuron (Unit ID 12) during the first 100 seconds of recording. Each vertical line represents the time when the neuron fired an action potential. The plot shows sporadic firing with clusters of activity at various timepoints.\n\n**Minor Issues:**\n- Given that this is displaying only one unit, the y-axis could be enhanced with a label indicating \"Unit 12\" rather than being unlabeled.\n\n**Major Issues:**\n- None. The figure effectively displays the spike times for this single unit, showing a typical sparse firing pattern common in neuronal recordings.\n\n### Image 4: Start times of first 50 'SAC_Wd15_Vel2_Bndry1_Cntst0_loop_presentations' presentations\n**Overview:**\nThis figure shows the start times for the first 50 presentations of a specific visual stimulus type (SAC_Wd15_Vel2_Bndry1_Cntst0_loop). Each blue dot represents the start of a stimulus presentation. The stimulus presentations appear to occur in a very regular pattern with equal spacing, starting at approximately 113.1 seconds and continuing until about 113.9 seconds.\n\n**Minor Issues:**\n- The y-axis has no label, though this is intentional since the dots are all positioned at y=0 and there is no meaningful y-dimension.\n\n**Major Issues:**\n- The time interval shown is extremely short (less than 1 second from 113.1 to 113.9 seconds), suggesting that these 50 stimulus presentations occurred in very rapid succession. This could be correct if these were individual frame presentations of a fast stimulus, but it could also indicate that only part of the stimulus sequence is being displayed.\n\nAll figures effectively visualize their respective data types from the NWB file, providing a good overview of the experimental measurements in this neurophysiology dataset.",
