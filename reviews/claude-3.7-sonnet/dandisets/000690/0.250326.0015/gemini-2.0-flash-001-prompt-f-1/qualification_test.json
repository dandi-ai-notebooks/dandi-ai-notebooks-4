    "image_descriptions": "There is only one image in the notebook, which is a plot of running speed versus time:\n\nThe figure shows a time series plot of running speed (measured in cm/s) against time (measured in seconds). The data spans approximately 7,000 seconds (or about 2 hours). The running speed mostly fluctuates around 0-10 cm/s with occasional bursts of higher activity. There's a particularly notable spike in running speed around the 5,500-6,000 second mark, where the speed briefly reaches about 65 cm/s, which is much higher than the typical activity levels.\n\nMinor issues:\n- None apparent; the figure has proper axis labels, a clear title, and appropriate scaling.\n\nMajor issues:\n- None apparent; the data looks reasonable for running speed measurements in a rodent. The data shows periods of rest (speeds near zero) interspersed with periods of activity (higher speeds), which is consistent with typical rodent behavior. The occasional negative values might represent backward movement or sensor noise, which can be common in these types of measurements.\n\nThe visualization effectively conveys the pattern of the animal's locomotor activity throughout the recording session, showing both typical activity and unusual bursts of high-speed running.",
