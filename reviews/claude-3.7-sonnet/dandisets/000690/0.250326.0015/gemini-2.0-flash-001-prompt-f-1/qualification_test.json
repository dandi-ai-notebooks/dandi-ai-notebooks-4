    "image_descriptions": "I'll provide a detailed description of the single figure that appears in the notebook:\n\n## Running Speed vs. Time Figure\n\n### Overview:\nThe figure shows a time series plot of running speed (in centimeters per second) versus time (in seconds). This data comes from the mouse's running wheel activity during the experiment. The x-axis shows time in seconds, spanning from approximately 0 to 7500 seconds (about 2 hours), while the y-axis shows running speed in cm/s, ranging from about -20 to about 65 cm/s.\n\n### What the plot reveals:\n- The mouse's running behavior appears episodic, with periods of relatively low activity interspersed with periods of higher running speed.\n- The running speed is mostly positive but occasionally becomes negative, possibly indicating changes in direction or measurement noise.\n- There's a notable spike in running speed reaching approximately 65 cm/s around the 5500-6000 second mark, which is significantly higher than the average running activity.\n- The baseline running speed when the animal is active seems to be around 10-20 cm/s, with many periods showing minimal movement (near zero).\n\n### Minor Issues:\n- No apparent minor formatting issues - the plot has clear titles, labeled axes, and appropriate scaling.\n- The plot uses an appropriate figure size (10x6) which makes the data easy to visualize.\n\n### Major Issues:\n- None evident. The data appears complete and consistent with what would be expected from running speed measurements in a rodent experiment.\n\nThe figure effectively visualizes the running behavior of the mouse throughout the recording session, which could be useful for correlating with neural activity or determining periods of active versus inactive behavior.",
