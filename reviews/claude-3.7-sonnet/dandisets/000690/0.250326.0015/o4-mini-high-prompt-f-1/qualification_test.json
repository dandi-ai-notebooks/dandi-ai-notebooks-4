    "image_descriptions": "There's one image in the notebook:\n\n### Eye tracking positions (first 1000 samples)\n\n**Overview:**\nThis scatter plot visualizes eye-tracking data from the NWB file, showing the first 1000 samples of gaze positions. The x and y coordinates represent spatial positions (in meters), and the color gradient (viridis colormap) represents time in seconds. The plot shows a dense cluster of eye positions concentrated primarily in one region of the visual field, with points colored from dark purple (earliest times) to yellow (latest times).\n\n**Minor issues:**\n- No gridlines are present, which might help with precise position reading\n- The axes scales have quite large values (240-300 for y-axis, 280-380 for x-axis) which suggests these may be pixel coordinates or some other units rather than actual meters as labeled\n- The plot title is slightly generic and could include more context about the experiment\n\n**Major issues:**\n- No significant major issues are apparent\n- The data visualization appears valid and interpretable showing natural eye movement patterns\n- There are a few isolated points far from the main cluster (notably around x=280, y=215) which could be outliers or tracking errors, but they represent a very small portion of the data\n\nThe visualization effectively shows a coherent pattern of eye movements over time, with a smooth progression from earlier to later timepoints, suggesting the recording captured continuous natural eye movements.",
