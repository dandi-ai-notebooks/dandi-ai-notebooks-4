    "image_descriptions": "There is only one image in the notebook, which is the scatter plot of eye-tracking positions. Here's a detailed description:\n\n**Eye-tracking positions scatter plot:**\n\n**Overview:**\n- The figure shows a scatter plot of eye-tracking position data from the NWB file\n- It displays the first 1000 samples of eye-tracking data\n- Points are plotted on X-Y coordinates (in meters)\n- Points are color-coded by timestamp (in seconds) with a viridis colormap\n- The majority of gaze positions form a cluster in the lower-right portion of the plot\n- There appears to be a smooth time gradient in the data points, suggesting continuous recording of eye movements\n- The timespan covers approximately 15-32 seconds based on the colorbar\n\n**Minor issues:**\n- The axis ranges are quite large (220-300 for Y and 280-380 for X), which suggests the units might be in millimeters rather than meters as labeled\n- The sparse outlier points (one near coordinates (280, 215) and one at the top-left) might benefit from investigation\n- The point size (s=5) is appropriate but could be adjusted based on the analysis goals\n\n**Major issues:**\n- No major issues with the visualization itself\n- The figure is appropriate for demonstrating how to access and visualize the eye-tracking data\n- There are no missing elements or uninterpretable aspects in the figure\n\nThe visualization effectively demonstrates the eye movement patterns and serves its purpose of illustrating data access and basic visualization from the NWB file.",
