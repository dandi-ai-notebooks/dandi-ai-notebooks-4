    "image_descriptions": "# Description of Images in the Notebook\n\nThe notebook contains three visualization figures that showcase different aspects of the neural data from the Allen Institute Openscope - Vision2Hippocampus project.\n\n## Image 1: Pupil Position Over Time\n\n**Overview:**\nThis figure shows pupil position tracking data over a time window from approximately 14.54 to 47.86 seconds. It's organized as a dual-panel plot with:\n- Top panel: Pupil X position (blue line) measured in meters\n- Bottom panel: Pupil Y position (orange line) measured in meters\n\n**Observations:**\n- The pupil position appears relatively stable for the first 20-25 seconds in both X and Y dimensions.\n- Around the 35-second mark, there's a significant change in pupil position, with more variable tracking afterward.\n- Several sharp spikes appear in both X and Y coordinates (particularly noticeable around 35s and 45s), which likely represent artifacts or temporary loss of tracking.\n- After approximately 35s, the pupil position shows more variability in both dimensions.\n\n**Minor issues:**\n- The Y-axis values (in meters) seem unusually large for pupil positions, suggesting these are likely scaled values or relative coordinates rather than absolute physical measurements.\n\n**Major issues:**\n- None. The plot successfully conveys the pupil position data, and the notebook correctly notes that the \"meters\" unit is likely representative of a scaled value.\n\n## Image 2: Running Speed Over Time\n\n**Overview:**\nThis figure displays the animal's running speed over time from approximately 113.13 to 344.68 seconds. The plot shows:\n- A single time series of running speed measured in cm/s\n- Clear periods of running activity interspersed with periods of inactivity\n\n**Observations:**\n- The running speed alternates between active periods (with speeds up to ~15 cm/s) and inactive periods (where speed hovers around zero).\n- Two main active periods are visible: one at the beginning of the time window (roughly 113-150s) and another later period (roughly 270-350s).\n- The speed shows both positive and negative values, which could indicate bidirectional movement on the running wheel.\n\n**Minor issues:**\n- None. The plot is well-labeled and appropriately formatted.\n\n**Major issues:**\n- None. The data appears to be cleanly visualized and the negative values are correctly interpreted in the notebook text as potentially indicating bidirectional wheel movement.\n\n## Image 3: Spike Raster Plot (First 20 Units)\n\n**Overview:**\nThis figure shows a raster plot of neural spiking activity for the first 20 units (neurons) from the dataset over a 60-second time window (20-80 seconds). Each horizontal row represents a different neuron, and each vertical line indicates the time of a spike (neural action potential).\n\n**Observations:**\n- Units are displayed from 12 to 31, using a color gradient from purple (lower units) to yellow (higher units).\n- There's considerable variability in firing rates and patterns across neurons.\n- Some units (like Unit 22 and Unit 24) show very high firing rates and consistent activity.\n- Other units (like Unit 19, Unit 21, and Unit 23) appear to be silent or nearly silent during this time window.\n- Some units show bursting patterns or periods of increased activity.\n- The raster reveals potential synchronized firing across multiple units at certain time points.\n\n**Minor issues:**\n- The y-axis is somewhat crowded with 20 unit labels, but still readable.\n\n**Major issues:**\n- None. This is an effective visualization of the spike times for multiple units.\n\nIn summary, all three visualizations effectively display their respective aspects of the dataset. The pupil tracking data shows eye movement dynamics, the running speed reveals behavioral state changes, and the spike raster illustrates neural firing patterns. Together they provide a multi-modal view of the experimental data, as intended by the notebook.",
