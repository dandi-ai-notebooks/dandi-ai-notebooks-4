The top subplot displays Pupil X position (in meters), and the bottom subplot shows Pupil Y position (in meters), both plotted against time (in seconds) from approximately 14.54s to 47.86s.\n\n### Overview:\n- The figure captures horizontal (X) and vertical (Y) pupil movements over roughly 33 seconds.\n- Both plots show mostly stable baseline periods with some dramatic shifts and spikes.\n- Around 35-45 seconds, there's a notable change in both X and Y positions, suggesting significant eye movement or possibly blinks.\n- Several sharp spikes appear in both channels (at ~38s, ~43s, ~45-46s), which likely represent artifacts, possibly from blinks as noted in the accompanying text.\n\n### Minor Issues:\n- The Y-axis scales differ between the two subplots, which might make direct visual comparison of movement magnitude challenging.\n- The unit \"meters\" is unusual for pupil position as noted in the text (these are likely scaled values rather than actual distances).\n\n### Major Issues:\n- None. The data appears to properly represent pupil tracking, including typical artifacts seen in eye tracking data.\n\n## Figure 2: Running Speed Over Time\nThis figure shows a time series of the animal's running speed plotted against time, covering approximately 113s to 345s of the recording.\n\n### Overview:\n- The plot shows running speed measured in cm/s over about 232 seconds.\n- There are distinct active periods (around 113-150s and 260-345s) when the animal was running.\n- Between these active periods (~150-260s), there's a quiescent period with minimal movement.\n- The speed varies between approximately -10 cm/s and 15 cm/s.\n\n### Minor Issues:\n- None significant. The plot is well-labeled and clearly shows the running patterns.\n\n### Major Issues:\n- None. The negative values in running speed were properly addressed in the accompanying note, explaining they likely represent bidirectional wheel movement or sensor characteristics.\n\n## Figure 3: Spike Raster Plot\nThis figure shows a raster plot displaying the spike times of 20 different neurons (units) over a 60-second period (from 20s to 80s).\n\n### Overview:\n- Each row represents a different neural unit (labeled Unit 12 through Unit 31).\n- Each vertical line represents a single action potential (spike) from that neuron.\n- Units display varying firing rates and patterns - some units are very active (e.g., Units 22 and 24), while others show sparse activity (e.g., Units 15, 19, 21, 23).\n- Some units show burst-like firing patterns (clusters of spikes), while others have more regular or irregular patterns.\n\n### Minor Issues:\n- None. The raster plot is well-formatted with clear labels and an appropriate color scheme.\n\n### Major Issues:\n- None. The plot successfully shows the spiking activity of multiple neurons over time, capturing their diverse firing patterns.\n\nOverall, the figures in this notebook effectively visualize three key data types from the Dandiset: pupil tracking data, running speed, and neural spiking activity. The visualizations are well-executed and appropriate for exploring the basic characteristics of the dataset.",
