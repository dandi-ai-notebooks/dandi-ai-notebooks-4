However, there are some key differences:\n\n1. **Notebook 1** is more focused on the basics of accessing and understanding the data structure, with clear explanations and careful error handling. It's more suitable for complete beginners.\n\n2. **Notebook 2** goes further in data analysis, showing more advanced techniques like PSTH and correlation analysis. It has more polished visualizations and demonstrates more types of analysis that could be performed.\n\nFor the specific purpose of \"getting started exploring the dandiset,\" I believe Notebook 1 is slightly better as it:\n- Is more focused on the fundamentals\n- Has clearer explanations of basic concepts\n- Includes better error handling for beginners\n- Explicitly manages resources (closing file handles)\n- Provides a more step-by-step introduction to the data\n\nWhile Notebook 2 has more advanced analysis, it might be a bit overwhelming for someone just getting started with the dataset. However, it would be excellent as a follow-up notebook after mastering the basics.",
