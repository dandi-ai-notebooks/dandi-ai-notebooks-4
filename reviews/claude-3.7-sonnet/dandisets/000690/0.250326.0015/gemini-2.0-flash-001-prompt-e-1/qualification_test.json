    "image_descriptions": "The notebook contains one figure titled \"LFP Data from Probe 0\". \n\nThis figure shows a line plot of Local Field Potential (LFP) data recorded from probe 0 of the ecephys recording. The plot displays a one-second segment of LFP data, spanning from 100 to 101 seconds in the recording. The x-axis represents time in seconds, and the y-axis represents the LFP voltage in volts (V).\n\nThe LFP trace shows typical neural oscillations with voltage fluctuations ranging approximately from -0.0002 V to 0.0002 V. The data appears to contain several oscillatory components of different frequencies superimposed on each other, which is characteristic of LFP recordings. There are some prominent peaks and troughs throughout the segment, with notable activity around 100.2-100.3 seconds.\n\nThe figure is well-formatted with:\n- A clear title\n- Properly labeled x-axis (\"Time (s)\") and y-axis (\"LFP (V)\")\n- Clean styling with a light grid background using the seaborn theme\n- Appropriate figure dimensions (10x5)\n\nI don't observe any minor or major issues with the figure. The visualization is clear, has appropriate axes labels, and the data appears to be loaded and displayed correctly. The LFP trace shows expected neural signal characteristics for this type of recording.",
