Each neuron's trace is plotted with a vertical offset for clarity.\n- **Minor issues**: None apparent; the figure is well-labeled with a clear title, x-axis (Time (s)) and y-axis (\u0394F/F (offset for clarity)), and includes a legend identifying each neuron.\n- **Major issues**: None; the data appears valid with neurons showing typical calcium transients.\n\n### Figure 2: Neuron Responses to Different Stimuli (Heatmap)\n- **Overview**: A heatmap displaying neuron responses (mean \u0394F/F) to four different stimuli types (Gray, Movie A, Movie B, Movie C) for 30 neurons. The neurons are sorted based on their stimulus preference.\n- **Minor issues**: None; the figure includes a good colorbar indicating mean \u0394F/F values, proper axis labels, and clear title.\n- **Major issues**: None; the data shows clear differential responses to the stimuli.\n\n### Figure 3: Distribution of Stimulus Preferences (Bar Chart)\n- **Overview**: A bar chart showing how many neurons prefer each stimulus type. The data shows most neurons (20) prefer Movie A, with fewer preferring Movie B (4) and Movie C (5), and only 1 preferring the Gray stimulus.\n- **Minor issues**: None; the chart is clear with appropriate labels and colors.\n- **Major issues**: None; the data distribution appears valid.\n\n### Figure 4: Neural Activity Heatmap\n- **Overview**: A heatmap displaying the activity of 50 neurons over a 200-second time window. Each row represents a neuron, and the color intensity indicates the \u0394F/F value.\n- **Minor issues**: None; the figure includes a good colorbar, axis labels, and title.\n- **Major issues**: None, though the activity appears sparse, which is typical for calcium imaging data.\n\n### Figure 5: Maximum Projection with Cell ROIs\n- **Overview**: This image shows the maximum projection of the calcium imaging data with colored dots indicating the neurons' stimulus preferences. Neurons preferring Movie A are orange, Movie B are green, Movie C are red, and Gray are black.\n- **Minor issues**: None; the image includes a colorbar for fluorescence intensity and a legend.\n- **Major issues**: None; the cells are clearly visible on the max projection image.\n\n### Figure 6: Neuron vs. Events Comparison Plots\n- **Overview**: Three plots showing the relationship between \u0394F/F traces (blue) and detected events (red) for three example neurons (1, 10, and 25) over a time slice.\n- **Minor issues**: None; the plots have clear labels and titles.\n- **Major issues**: None; the events appear to correspond well with calcium transients in the \u0394F/F traces.\n\n### Figure 7: Running Speed and Neural Activity Correlation\n- **Overview**: Four panels showing the relationship between running speed (top panel) and neural activity for three neurons (remaining panels) that showed the highest correlation with running speed.\n- **Minor issues**: None; all panels are properly labeled with correlation values provided.\n- **Major issues**: None; the data shows clear temporal relationships between running and neural activity.\n\n### Figure 8: Segmentation Mask\n- **Overview**: An image showing the binary segmentation masks of all identified neurons in the field of view.\n- **Minor issues**: The color scale doesn't represent different ROIs as intended - the masks appear all in the same gray color rather than different colors for different neurons.\n- **Major issues**: None; the segmentation masks appear to capture neuronal shapes appropriately.\n\n### Figure 9: Cell ROIs on Max Projection\n- **Overview**: The maximum projection image with overlaid ROI markers and rectangles for 20 selected cells, each in a different color.\n- **Minor issues**: No legend for the different colored boxes, making it difficult to identify which cell is which.\n- **Major issues**: None; the ROIs appear to be accurately placed on cell bodies visible in the max projection.\n\nIn summary, the visualizations effectively present the calcium imaging data, allowing examination of neural activity patterns, stimulus preferences, and spatial organization of the neurons.",
