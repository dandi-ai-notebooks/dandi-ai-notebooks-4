    "image_descriptions": "# Description of Images in the Notebook\n\n## Image 1: Motion Correction Plot\n- **Overview**: This figure shows motion correction data for the first 5000 timepoints of the recording, with X motion in blue and Y motion in red plotted against time in seconds.\n- **Content Details**: The plot shows that there is moderate motion throughout the recording, with Y-motion (10-15 pixels) consistently higher than X-motion (5-8 pixels). There are several motion spikes in the beginning of the recording, with peaks reaching 20+ pixels in the Y direction.\n- **Minor Issues**: None, the plot is well-labeled with a clear title, legend, and axis labels.\n- **Major Issues**: None, the data appears valid and interpretable.\n\n## Image 2: DF/F Traces for Selected ROIs\n- **Overview**: This figure displays calcium activity (\u0394F/F) traces for 5 randomly selected ROIs (Regions of Interest, or neurons) over the first 1000 timepoints.\n- **Content Details**: The plot shows five subplots, each representing a different neuron (ROIs 15, 31, 85, 1, and 102). Each neuron shows different patterns of calcium transients reflecting their unique activity profiles. Some neurons (like ROI 85 and ROI 1) show large, distinct calcium events while others (like ROI 31) show more frequent but smaller fluctuations.\n- **Minor Issues**: None, the figure is well-organized with proper labeling.\n- **Major Issues**: None, the neural activity appears to be of good quality with clear calcium transients.\n\n## Image 3: Average Neural Responses to Different Stimuli\n- **Overview**: This figure contains four subplots showing the average neural responses across cells to each stimulus type: gray screen, movie clip A, movie clip B, and movie clip C.\n- **Content Details**: Each subplot shows the average \u0394F/F response over time, with vertical dashed lines marking stimulus onset (red) and approximate stimulus end (green).\n- **Minor Issues**: None, the plots are well-labeled with appropriate axes and titles.\n- **Major Issues**: None, though it's worth noting that the responses don't show strong differentiation between stimulus types.\n\n## Image 4: Stimulus-Specific Responses of Individual Neurons\n- **Overview**: This figure contains four subplots showing the responses of individual neurons that respond strongly to each stimulus type.\n- **Content Details**: Each subplot shows the response of a single neuron (the most responsive cell) to all stimulus types, with different colored lines for each stimulus. The cell IDs and their maximum response amplitudes are indicated in the titles.\n- **Minor Issues**: None, the plots are well-labeled with clear legends.\n- **Major Issues**: None, though it's noteworthy that even the \"most responsive\" cells don't show very strong stimulus specificity.\n\n## Image 5: Running Speed Over Time\n- **Overview**: This figure shows the mouse's running speed (cm/s) over the first 10,000 timepoints of the recording.\n- **Content Details**: The plot shows periods of high activity (up to 50 cm/s) interspersed with periods of inactivity, indicating that the mouse moves in bouts.\n- **Minor Issues**: None, the plot is properly labeled.\n- **Major Issues**: None, the data appears valid.\n\n## Image 6: Neural Activity and Running Speed Comparison\n- **Overview**: This figure contains two subplots showing the relationship between neural activity and running speed. The top subplot shows the \u0394F/F trace of the neuron most correlated with running (ROI 10), and the bottom subplot shows the corresponding running speed.\n- **Content Details**: Visual comparison of the two plots shows that peaks in neural activity often coincide with periods when the mouse is running, supporting the correlation value of r = 0.332.\n- **Minor Issues**: None, the plot is well-organized and labeled.\n- **Major Issues**: None, the data clearly illustrates the relationship.\n\n## Image 7: High vs. Low Running Neural Activity Comparison\n- **Overview**: This scatter plot compares average neural activity during high running periods versus low running periods for all neurons.\n- **Content Details**: Each dot represents a neuron, with its position indicating its average activity during high (x-axis) and low (y-axis) running. The diagonal dashed line represents equal activity in both conditions. Points below the line indicate higher activity during running. The three most positively correlated cells are highlighted in red, and the three most negatively correlated cells in blue.\n- **Minor Issues**: None, the plot is properly labeled with a clear legend.\n- **Major Issues**: None, though the data is somewhat sparse with most points clustered near the origin with low values.\n\n## Image 8: ROI Positions with Running Correlations\n- **Overview**: This figure shows the spatial distribution of neurons (ROIs) in the field of view, with colors indicating each neuron's correlation with running speed.\n- **Content Details**: The plot displays the x and y positions of all neurons in pixels, with a color scale from blue to red representing the correlation with running (more red = more positive correlation).\n- **Minor Issues**: None, the plot is well-labeled with a color bar.\n- **Major Issues**: None, though there doesn't appear to be a strong spatial clustering of running-correlated neurons.",
