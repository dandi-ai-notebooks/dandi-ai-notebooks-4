It offers more direct connections between the analyses and the physiological phenomena being studied, and includes more advanced visualizations that specifically address the research focus. Notebook 2's line profile analysis and vessel vs. background pixel comparison directly demonstrate techniques that would be useful for the Dandiset's stated purpose.\n\nTherefore, Notebook 2 is marginally better in terms of helping users understand how to work with this specific Dandiset for its intended purpose.",
