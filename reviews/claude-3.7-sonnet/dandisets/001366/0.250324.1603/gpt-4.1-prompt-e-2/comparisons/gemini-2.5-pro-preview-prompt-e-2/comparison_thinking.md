I'll compare both notebooks based on the provided criteria:

### Title including Dandiset name:
- Both notebooks have appropriate titles mentioning "Comparison of Approaches for Surface Vessel Diameter and Pulsatility Quantification" (Dandiset 001366).

### AI-generated warning message:
- Both notebooks include appropriate warnings. Notebook 1 has a clear caution message at the beginning, and Notebook 2 has a similar "Important Note" about being AI-generated.

### Dandiset overview and link:
- Both notebooks provide a good overview of the Dandiset with links.
- Notebook 1 includes a formal citation and DOI, which is slightly more comprehensive.
- Notebook 2 provides the URL in a cleaner format.

### Summary of notebook coverage:
- Notebook 2 has a dedicated "What this notebook covers" section with a clear numbered list.
- Notebook 1 has "Notebook Objectives" which covers similar information but is slightly less explicitly organized.

### Required packages:
- Both notebooks list required packages.
- Notebook 2 includes seaborn which isn't in Notebook 1, and provides slightly more context about the packages.

### Loading Dandiset with DANDI API:
- Both notebooks properly demonstrate loading the Dandiset using the DANDI API.
- Notebook 1 explicitly prints more metadata fields.
- Notebook 2 shows how to limit output (using islice) which is a good practice for potentially large lists.

### Loading NWB files and metadata:
- Both notebooks demonstrate loading NWB files correctly.
- Notebook 1 loads a smaller file, which is more practical for a demo notebook.
- Notebook 2 loads a larger file (2.3GB vs 408MB) which might cause performance issues.
- Both display key metadata from the NWB file correctly.

### Description of available data:
- Notebook 1 provides a better structured overview of the file format using both text and a diagram.
- Notebook 1 has a more formal "NWB File Structure Overview" section with a table format.

### Data loading and visualization:
- Both notebooks demonstrate loading and visualizing data from the NWB file.
- Notebook 1 shows multiple frames from the movie series, which gives a better view of the data over time.
- Notebook 2 shows just a single frame but with a better colorbar.
- Notebook 1 uses a plot of mean frame intensity over time, which is more relevant to the dataset's focus on vessel pulsatility.
- Notebook 2 shows a pixel time series which is interesting but less informative than the mean intensity series.

### Advanced visualizations:
- Notebook 1's visualization of multiple frames across the time series and the mean intensity plot together provide a more complete picture of the data.
- Notebook 2's pixel intensity time trace is useful but doesn't demonstrate as much about vessel pulsatility as Notebook 1's approach.

### Summary and future directions:
- Both notebooks provide good summaries and suggest future directions.
- Notebook 1's directions are more closely tied to the explicit keywords of the dataset (Radon transform, FWHM).
- Notebook 2 provides more structure to its suggestions with numbered points.

### Explanatory markdown cells:
- Both notebooks have good explanatory markdown cells.
- Notebook 1 has more detailed explanations of the specific data structures.

### Code documentation and neurophysiology best practices:
- Both notebooks are well-documented.
- Notebook 1 includes better safety checks (e.g., downsampling for visualization).
- Notebook 2 explicitly mentions read-only mode for file handling which is good practice.

### Focus on basics without overanalysis:
- Both notebooks stay focused on exploration without overanalyzing.
- Notebook 1 is slightly more focused on the core pulsatility aspect of the dataset.

### Visualization clarity:
- Both notebooks have clear visualizations.
- Notebook 1's multiple frames give better insight into the temporal nature of the data.
- Notebook 2's visualizations have better axis labels and colorbars.

### Overall assessment:

Notebook 1 does a better job on several key dimensions:
1. It selects a smaller, more manageable file for demonstration
2. It visualizes multiple frames over time, which is more relevant to the vessel pulsatility focus
3. It provides a more structured overview of the NWB file format
4. Its future directions are more closely tied to the specific keywords of the dataset
5. It includes better safety measures for handling large datasets

Notebook 2 has some strengths:
1. More structured summary of what it covers
2. Better visualization formatting (labels, colorbars)
3. Explicit mention of read-only file handling
4. A clean numbered list of future directions

While both notebooks are solid, Notebook 1 does a better job of helping users understand the core focus of the dataset (vessel pulsatility) through its visualizations and explanations. Its selection of a smaller file is also more practical for a demonstration notebook. Therefore, Notebook 1 is the better option overall.
