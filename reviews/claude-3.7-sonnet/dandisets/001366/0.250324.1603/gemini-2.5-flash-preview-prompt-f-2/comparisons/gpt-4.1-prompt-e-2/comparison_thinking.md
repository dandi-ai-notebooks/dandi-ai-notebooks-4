I'll compare the two notebooks based on the criteria provided, evaluating how well each one helps a user get started with exploring Dandiset 001366.

## Basic Requirements
Both notebooks include:
- A title that mentions Dandiset 001366
- A warning about being AI-generated 
- An overview of the Dandiset with a link
- Required packages
- Loading the Dandiset with DANDI API
- Loading an NWB file and displaying metadata
- Descriptions of available data
- Visualization of the image data
- Summary of findings and future directions

## Detailed Comparison

### Title and Warning
- Both include appropriate titles mentioning the Dandiset name
- Both include warnings about AI generation and verification needs

### Overview and Structure
- Notebook 2 provides more detailed metadata, including keywords and citation information
- Notebook 2 has clearer section organization with more explanatory markdown
- Notebook 2 presents a more structured approach to exploring the data

### Required Packages
- Both adequately list the required packages
- Notebook 2 explicitly notes that installation commands are not included

### Loading the Dandiset
- Both notebooks correctly use the DANDI API
- Notebook 2 provides more details about the assets, including file sizes
- Notebook 2 provides clearer explanations of what's happening at each step

### Loading the NWB File
- Both correctly load an NWB file and show metadata
- Notebook 2 displays the metadata in a more organized, readable format
- Notebook 1 and Notebook 2 use different NWB files from the same Dandiset

### Data Description 
- Both describe the data available
- Notebook 2 includes a more structured overview of the NWB file contents using tables and text formatting
- Notebook 2 provides a clearer explanation of the data organization

### Visualizations
- Both notebooks visualize movie frames
- Notebook 1 shows 6 frames from the same movie at different time points
- Notebook 2 shows 5 frames but adds a time series visualization showing mean frame intensity over time, which provides insight into possible pulsatility
- Notebook 2's visualizations include more informative titles and better organization

### Advanced Analysis
- Notebook 2 includes a simple but useful time series analysis (mean intensity over time)
- Notebook 1 mentions but does not implement more complex analyses due to streaming constraints

### Summary and Future Directions
- Both provide good summaries and suggest future directions
- Notebook 2's future directions are more specific and tied directly to the dataset's keywords

### Code Quality and Documentation
- Both have well-documented code
- Notebook 2's code includes more comments and clearer variable naming
- Notebook 2 includes more explanatory markdown between code cells

### Clarity and Ease of Following
- Notebook 2 provides a more structured flow with clearer explanations
- Notebook 2 uses formatting (tables, bullet points, etc.) to enhance readability
- Notebook 2's explanations and metadata presentation are more comprehensive

### Helping Understanding
- Notebook 2 better explains the structure of the NWB file with a text diagram
- Notebook 2 provides more context about the Dandiset (citation, keywords)
- Notebook 2 shows more metadata exploration (keywords and attributes)

### Visualizations
- Both notebooks provide clear visualizations of movie frames
- Notebook 2 adds the time series visualization which provides additional insight
- Notebook 2's visualizations have better formatting (titles, suptitles, etc.)

### Overall Helpfulness
- Both notebooks would help a user get started with the Dandiset
- Notebook 2 provides a more comprehensive, well-structured introduction with better explanations and visualizations

## Conclusion
While both notebooks meet the basic requirements and would help a user get started with the Dandiset, Notebook 2 is superior in most aspects. It provides better structure, clearer explanations, more comprehensive metadata exploration, additional visualizations showing temporal patterns, and better formatting. Notebook 2 would leave a user with a better understanding of the Dandiset and more confidence in exploring it further.

Therefore, Notebook 2 is the better notebook.
