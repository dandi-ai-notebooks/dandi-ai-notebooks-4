- Notebook 1 provides a more detailed overview with keywords and a structured outline
- Both include the DOI/URL

### Summary of notebook content
- Both notebooks provide a summary of what they will cover
- Notebook 1 has a more detailed and structured outline of what will be covered
- Notebook 2's summary is more concise

### Required packages
- Both notebooks list the required packages
- Notebook 1 actually loads all packages it will use in a single cell
- Notebook 2 explains the assumptions about installed packages but loads them gradually

### Loading the Dandiset using DANDI API
- Both notebooks demonstrate how to load the Dandiset using the DANDI API
- Notebook 1 includes error handling in case connecting to DANDI fails
- Both successfully display basic metadata

### Loading NWB files and showing metadata
- Both notebooks demonstrate loading NWB files and displaying metadata
- Notebook 1 loads and explores two different NWB files from the Dandiset
- Notebook 2 focuses on only one of the NWB files but provides a more structured display of the metadata in a table

### Description of available data
- Both notebooks describe what data are available in the NWB file(s)
- Notebook 1 provides a more detailed exploration of the acquisition data, showing shape, data type, etc.
- Notebook 2 shows the file hierarchy in a structured way

### Loading and visualizing data
- Both notebooks demonstrate how to load and visualize the data
- Notebook 1 has more extensive visualizations:
  - Frame visualization with contrast enhancement
  - Multiple frames over time
  - Vessel profiling and FWHM measurement
  - Pulsatility analysis
  - Kymographs
- Notebook 2 has simpler but well-explained visualizations:
  - Mean image
  - Sample frame
  - Time series from ROI
  - Kymograph

### Advanced visualizations
- Notebook 1 includes more advanced visualizations:
  - FWHM vessel diameter estimation
  - Time-series analysis of vessel diameter 
  - Spectral analysis for pulse rate estimation
  - Comparison between two NWB files
- Notebook 2's visualizations are more basic but adequately illustrate the key aspects of the data

### Summary and future directions
- Both notebooks include a summary of findings and future directions
- Notebook 1's conclusion is more detailed with specific suggestions for further analysis
- Notebook 2's next steps section is shorter but still provides useful guidance

### Explanatory markdown
- Both notebooks have good explanatory markdown cells
- Notebook 1 has more detailed explanations of the analysis process and findings
- Notebook 2's explanations are concise but clear

### Documentation and best practices
- Both notebooks have well-documented code
- Notebook 1 includes more extensive error handling and comments
- Both follow reasonable practices for neurophysiology data analysis

### Focus on getting started
- Both notebooks focus on getting started with the Dandiset
- Notebook 1 goes into more detailed analysis, which could be considered overanalysis for a starter notebook
- Notebook 2 stays more focused on the basics

### Visualization quality
- Both notebooks have clear visualizations
- Notebook 1's visualizations are more numerous and detailed
- Notebook 2's visualizations are simpler but effective for introducing the data

Overall assessment:
Notebook 1 is more comprehensive, with detailed analysis of two NWB files, advanced visualizations, and extensive explanations. It provides a deeper dive into the vessel diameter quantification methods mentioned in the Dandiset description.

Notebook 2 is more focused on the basics, with clearer structure and presentation of metadata, but less detailed analysis. It provides a good introduction but less depth.

For a starter notebook, Notebook 2 does a better job of focusing on the basics without overanalysis. However, Notebook 1 provides more value in terms of showing what can be done with this specific dataset, especially in relation to the core purpose of the Dandiset (comparing approaches for vessel diameter and pulsatility quantification).

The decision comes down to whether we value simplicity and focus (Notebook 2) or depth and comprehensiveness (Notebook 1). Given that the criteria specifically state that the notebook should "focus on the basics of getting started" and "should not include overanalysis," Notebook 2 is arguably better aligned with this guideline. However, for users interested in the specific scientific questions this Dandiset was created to address, Notebook 1 provides more immediate value.

After careful consideration, I believe Notebook 1 is superior because:
1. It demonstrates working with multiple files in the Dandiset, not just one
2. It implements actual vessel diameter measurement methods (FWHM) that are directly related to the Dandiset's purpose
3. It provides more comprehensive examples that would be more useful for researchers in this specific field
4. While it goes beyond the basics, it does so in ways that are directly relevant to the dataset's purpose

The "basics" for working with a specialized dataset like this should include examples of the core analyses the dataset was designed to support, which Notebook 1 provides more thoroughly.
