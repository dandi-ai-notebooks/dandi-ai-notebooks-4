    "image_descriptions": "# Detailed Description of Images in the Notebook\n\n## Image 1: Mouse Position Over Time\n**Overview:** This plot shows the mouse's position (y-axis, in cm) over time (x-axis, in seconds) during the VR experiment. The graph displays a sawtooth pattern indicating the mouse repeatedly traverses the virtual track, ranging approximately from -50 to 450 cm. The pattern shows clear teleportations where the position suddenly resets (vertical lines dropping from top to bottom), which is typical in VR experiments when the animal reaches the end of a track and is teleported back to the start.\n\n**Minor issues:** None notable. The axes are properly labeled, the title indicates this is a subset of the full dataset (5000/20684 points), and the grid lines help with readability.\n\n**Major issues:** None. The data appears to be valid and shows expected patterns for a virtual linear track experiment.\n\n## Image 2: Mouse Speed Over Time\n**Overview:** This figure shows the mouse's speed (y-axis, in cm/s) over the same time period as the position plot. The speed fluctuates between 0 and approximately 75 cm/s, showing periods of movement interspersed with stops (where speed drops to zero).\n\n**Minor issues:** None notable. The plot is well-labeled and formatted.\n\n**Major issues:** None. The data shows reasonable speed patterns for a mouse in a VR environment, with natural acceleration/deceleration cycles.\n\n## Image 3: Summary 2-Photon Imaging Data (Three Panel Figure)\n**Overview:** This is a three-panel figure showing summary imaging data:\n1. **Left panel (Mean Fluorescence Image):** Shows the average brightness across all imaging frames, with brighter spots likely representing neurons.\n2. **Middle panel (Max Projection Image):** Shows the maximum intensity at each pixel across all frames, highlighting cells that were active during the session.\n3. **Right panel (Pixel Correlation Image):** Shows spatial correlation between pixels over time, with brighter/colorful regions indicating pixels whose fluorescence fluctuates together, typically corresponding to individual neurons.\n\n**Minor issues:** None significant. All panels have appropriate colorbars and titles.\n\n**Major issues:** None. The images show expected patterns for 2-photon calcium imaging of neuronal activity.\n\n## Image 4: ROI Footprints\n**Overview:** This image shows the spatial footprints of all 349 detected Regions of Interest (ROIs), which correspond to putative neurons. Each bright spot represents an ROI, with the brightness/color intensity indicating the weight of pixels belonging to that ROI.\n\n**Minor issues:** None notable. The image has proper labels and a colorbar.\n\n**Major issues:** None. The distribution of ROIs matches what would be expected from the summary images, with brighter regions in the correlation image corresponding to clusters of identified ROIs.\n\n## Image 5: Fluorescence Traces\n**Overview:** This figure shows fluorescence traces for 5 selected ROIs over time. Each subplot represents a different neuron (ROIs 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6), with the y-axis showing fluorescence intensity (in \"lumens\") and the x-axis showing time (in seconds). The traces show characteristic calcium signals with sharp increases followed by more gradual decays, indicating neuronal activity events.\n\n**Minor issues:** None significant. The plot is well-organized with each ROI clearly labeled.\n\n**Major issues:** None. The traces show realistic calcium imaging data with expected transients.\n\n## Image 6: Activity vs. Position Plots (Two Panel Figure)\n**Overview:** This two-panel figure shows the relationship between neural activity and the animal's position for two neurons (ROI 2 and ROI 6):\n- The red line shows mean deconvolved activity (left y-axis) as a function of position (x-axis)\n- The blue bars show occupancy - how much time the animal spent in each spatial bin (right y-axis)\n\n**Minor issues:** There appears to be minimal data in the negative position range (-500 to -200 cm), likely because the animal spent very little time there. This makes it difficult to assess neural activity in that region.\n\n**Major issues:** None significant. For ROI 2, there appears to be higher activity in the positive position range, while ROI 6 shows increasing activity toward the far positive end of the track (~400 cm), suggesting different spatial tuning for these neurons. The data is consistent with what would be expected from hippocampal place cells, which show increased activity in specific spatial locations.\n\nOverall, the plots in this notebook effectively visualize the key aspects of this dataset, showing both behavioral data and neural activity patterns in the hippocampus during virtual navigation.",
