    "thinking": "Let me evaluate both notebooks systematically against the provided criteria:\n\n### Basic Requirements\n- **Title including Dandiset name**: Both notebooks have clear titles that include the Dandiset name.\n- **AI-generated disclaimer**: Both notebooks include this disclaimer.\n- **Dandiset overview with link**: Both notebooks provide this information.\n- **Summary of notebook coverage**: Both notebooks include this.\n- **Required packages**: Both notebooks list required packages.\n\n### Data Access\n- **Loading Dandiset via DANDI API**: Both notebooks demonstrate this well.\n- **Loading NWB file with metadata**: Both notebooks accomplish this.\n- **Description of available data**: Both notebooks describe the data structure, though Notebook 1 does so a bit more systematically.\n\n### Data Visualization\n- **Instructions for loading and visualizing data**: Both notebooks provide these.\n- **Variety of visualizations**: Both notebooks visualize behavioral and imaging data.\n- **Advanced visualization (multiple data types)**: Notebook 2 includes a more advanced correlation between neural activity and position that Notebook 1 doesn't have.\n\n### Documentation and Guidance\n- **Explanatory markdown cells**: Both notebooks include these, though Notebook 1 seems to have slightly more detailed explanations.\n- **Well-documented code**: Both notebooks have well-documented code.\n\n### Focus and Clarity\n- **Focus on basics without overanalysis**: Both notebooks maintain appropriate focus.\n- **Clear visualizations**: Both have clear visualizations.\n\n### Additional Considerations\n- **NWB file structure understanding**: Notebook 1 provides a more structured overview of the NWB file contents.\n- **Future directions**: Both notebooks discuss potential next steps.\n\n### Notable differences:\n1. Notebook 2 includes a neuron-behavior correlation visualization (fluorescence vs. position) that Notebook 1 doesn't have, which is a more sophisticated analysis.\n2. Notebook 1 has a cleaner presentation of the NWB file structure and provides a tabular summary of behavioral time series.\n3. The visualizations of behavioral data are more extensive in Notebook 2, showing a longer time period (650s vs 60s in Notebook 1).\n4. Notebook 1 uses streaming to access the NWB file without downloading it locally, which is explicitly mentioned as an advantage.\n5. The ROI visualization in Notebook 2 includes the actual mean image as background, making it more informative than just showing the pixel masks.\n\nBoth notebooks are quite good and cover most of the required elements. The key differences come down to:\n- Notebook 1 has a better structured explanation of the NWB file contents and emphasizes the streaming capability.\n- Notebook 2 includes a more advanced neuron-behavior correlation analysis and slightly better visualizations.\n\nOn balance, I find Notebook 2 to be slightly better due to the inclusion of the neuron-behavior correlation analysis which demonstrates a more complete workflow from raw data to biological interpretation. This addresses the criterion about \"a more advanced visualization involving more than one piece of data\" more effectively. Additionally, the visualizations in Notebook 2 show more of the data (longer time periods) which gives a better sense of the dataset's structure.",
