    "image_descriptions": "# Description of Figures in the Notebook\n\n## Figure 1: \"Position vs. Time\"\n\n**Overview:**\nThis figure shows the position of the mouse in a virtual linear track over time. The x-axis represents time in seconds (ranging from 0 to approximately 1,400 seconds), and the y-axis shows position in centimeters (ranging from approximately -400 to 400 cm). The data shows a sawtooth pattern, which is typical of an animal repeatedly traversing a linear track with periodic resets or \"teleports\" back to the start position.\n\n**Minor issues:**\n- None noted. The figure has clear axis labels, title, and formatting.\n\n**Major issues:**\n- None. The figure effectively displays the repeated traversals of the virtual linear track over the experimental session.\n\n## Figure 2: \"Deconvolved Fluorescence for First 5 Cells\"\n\n**Overview:**\nThis figure shows the deconvolved calcium fluorescence data for the first 5 cells (neurons) recorded during the experiment. The x-axis represents time in frames (ranging from 0 to about 20,000 frames), and the y-axis shows the deconvolved fluorescence intensity. Each colored line represents a different cell, as indicated in the legend. The data shows sporadic periods of high activity (calcium transients) against a background of lower activity, which is typical for neuronal recordings.\n\n**Minor issues:**\n- It might be useful to convert the x-axis from frames to seconds for easier comparison with the behavioral data in Figure 1.\n- The y-axis could benefit from a unit label (although \"Deconvolved Fluorescence\" is provided).\n\n**Major issues:**\n- None. The figure appropriately visualizes calcium activity of individual neurons, showing clear activity patterns and differentiating between cells.\n\nBoth figures provide a good initial visualization of the key data types in this dataset. The first figure shows the behavioral component (animal position), and the second figure shows some of the neural activity data. Together, they give a basic overview of the types of analyses that could be performed by relating neural activity to behavioral variables.",
