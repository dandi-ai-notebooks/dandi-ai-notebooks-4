The x-axis represents time in seconds (spanning approximately 0-1400 seconds), while the y-axis shows position in centimeters (ranging from about -500 to 450 cm).\n\nThe pattern shows repeated traversals along the track, appearing as sawtooth or triangular waves. The mouse moves from one position to another and then quickly resets (likely representing teleportation between trials). This pattern is consistent throughout the recording session, indicating multiple trials where the animal navigated through the virtual environment.\n\n### Minor Issues\n- No apparent minor formatting issues - the axes are appropriately labeled, and the title is descriptive.\n\n### Major Issues\n- No major issues with the data visualization. The figure effectively shows the position data over time and reveals the trial structure of the experiment.\n- Note that there appears to be an initial position value that's very negative (around -500 cm) at the beginning of the recording, which could be initialization data before the actual trials began.\n\n## Figure 2: Deconvolved Fluorescence for First 5 Cells\n\n### Overview\nThis figure displays the deconvolved calcium fluorescence signals from the first 5 cells recorded during the imaging session. The x-axis shows time in frames (spanning approximately 0-20,000 frames), and the y-axis shows the deconvolved fluorescence intensity (ranging from 0 to roughly 11,000 units).\n\nEach colored line represents a different cell's activity over time. The data shows irregular spiking patterns typical of neuronal activity, with Cell 1 (orange) demonstrating particularly high activity around the 10,000-frame mark.\n\n### Minor Issues\n- No apparent minor formatting issues - the plot includes a proper legend identifying each cell, clear axis labels, and an informative title.\n\n### Major Issues\n- No major issues with the visualization. The data appears to represent genuine neuronal activity with typical calcium imaging deconvolved signals (sparse activity with clear transients).\n- It's worth noting that Cell 1 has a very large peak (reaching around 11,000 units) around frame 10,000, which is substantially larger than most of the other activity. This could represent a particularly strong burst of activity or potentially an artifact, but without additional context, it's difficult to determine.\n\nBoth figures effectively visualize key aspects of the dataset and provide useful information about the mouse's behavior and the associated neural activity patterns recorded during the experiment.",
