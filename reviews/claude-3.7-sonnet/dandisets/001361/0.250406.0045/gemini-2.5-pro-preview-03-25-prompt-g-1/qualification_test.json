The x-axis represents time in seconds (ranging from 0 to about 1400 seconds), and the y-axis represents position in centimeters (ranging from approximately -500 to 500 cm). The blue line represents the mouse's position, which shows a clear pattern of repeated traversals up and down the track.\n\n**Minor Issues:**\n- None notable; the figure has proper axis labels, a title, legend, and grid lines that make it easy to interpret.\n\n**Major Issues:**\n- None. The figure clearly shows the relationship between mouse movement patterns and reward delivery times.\n\n**Additional Observations:**\n- The pattern shows the mouse repeatedly traversing the track, with position values cycling between high and low values.\n- Reward events (red dashed lines) appear to occur at fairly regular intervals throughout the session.\n- There's a brief anomaly in the position data around the 700-second mark, which might represent a reset or adjustment in the tracking.\n\n## Figure 2: Deconvolved Fluorescence Traces for First 3 Cell ROIs\n\n**Overview:**\nThis figure displays deconvolved fluorescence traces (representing neural activity) for three neurons (Regions of Interest or ROIs) identified in the dataset. The x-axis shows time in seconds (0 to ~1200 seconds), and the y-axis shows deconvolved fluorescence in \"lumens\" (ranging from 0 to ~4200). Each colored line represents a different ROI (blue for ROI 2, orange for ROI 3, and green for ROI 4).\n\n**Minor Issues:**\n- None notable; the figure includes appropriate axis labels, title, and a legend identifying each ROI.\n\n**Major Issues:**\n- None. The figure clearly shows the activity patterns of the selected neurons over time.\n\n**Additional Observations:**\n- The neurons show distinct spiking patterns with varying amplitudes.\n- ROI 4 (green) shows several very high amplitude spikes, particularly around 600 seconds.\n- ROI 3 (orange) has a notable high-amplitude event around 400 seconds.\n- All three neurons show periods of both high and low activity throughout the recording.\n\n## Figure 3: Mean Image with ROI Masks\n\n**Overview:**\nThis figure shows the mean fluorescence image from the 2-photon recording, with colored overlays indicating the locations of the three ROIs (neurons) whose activity was plotted in the previous figure. The grayscale background shows the average fluorescence across the entire recording session, while the colored highlights show the spatial masks of the selected ROIs (2, 3, and 4). The colorbar indicates the weight or intensity of the ROI masks.\n\n**Minor Issues:**\n- The colorbar label indicates \"Max ROI Weight (0-1)\" but the scale shows values ranging from 0 to approximately 170, suggesting a scaling inconsistency.\n- The ROI masks appear quite small relative to the entire field of view, making them somewhat difficult to see without zooming in.\n\n**Major Issues:**\n- None that prevent interpretation. The figure successfully shows the spatial locations of the ROIs within the imaging field.\n\n**Additional Observations:**\n- The three highlighted ROIs appear to be located in the central portion of the imaging field.\n- The brighter area in the center of the mean image likely represents the region with the most neural tissue visible during imaging.\n- The ROIs are relatively closely spaced but distinct from one another.\n- The field of view shows what appears to be hippocampal CA1 tissue with visible cellular structures.\n\nAll three figures effectively support the notebook's goal of demonstrating how to access and visualize both behavioral and neural data from this Dandiset.",
