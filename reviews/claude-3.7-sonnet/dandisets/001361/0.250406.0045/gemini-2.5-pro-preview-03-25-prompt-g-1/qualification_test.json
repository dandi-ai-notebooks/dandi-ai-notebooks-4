    "image_descriptions": "# Image Descriptions\n\n## Figure 1: Mouse Position Over Time with Reward Events\n- **Overview:** This figure shows the mouse's position along a virtual linear track (y-axis, in cm) over time (x-axis, in seconds). The blue line represents the mouse's position, while vertical red dashed lines indicate when rewards were delivered.\n- **Key features:** \n  - The position data shows a repetitive pattern of movement, with the mouse regularly traversing from approximately -500 cm to +450 cm.\n  - The reward events (red dashed lines) appear to align consistently with certain positions, suggesting rewards were delivered at specific locations on the track.\n  - The session lasted approximately 1400 seconds (~23 minutes).\n- **Minor issues:** None. The figure is well-formatted with clear labels, title, and legend.\n- **Major issues:** None. The data appears valid and interpretable.\n\n## Figure 2: Deconvolved Fluorescence Traces for First 3 Cell ROIs\n- **Overview:** This figure displays the deconvolved calcium fluorescence activity for three neurons (ROIs 2, 3, and 4) over the same time period as the behavioral data.\n- **Key features:**\n  - Each colored line represents a different neuron's activity.\n  - The y-axis shows deconvolved fluorescence in \"lumens\" units, which represents inferred neural activity.\n  - All three neurons show distinct spiking patterns with occasional large peaks (especially ROI 4, in green).\n  - The activity appears sparse with clear events rather than continuous.\n- **Minor issues:** None. The figure is well-formatted with appropriate labels, title, and legend.\n- **Major issues:** None. The data appears valid and shows typical calcium imaging deconvolved signals.\n\n## Figure 3: Mean Image with ROI Masks\n- **Overview:** This figure shows the mean fluorescence image from the 2-photon recording with spatial masks of the three selected ROIs (neurons) overlaid in color.\n- **Key features:**\n  - The grayscale background shows the average fluorescence across the imaging session.\n  - The colored areas (in red/orange) represent the three ROIs that were analyzed in the previous plot.\n  - The ROIs are clustered in the central-right area of the field of view.\n  - The colorbar represents the weight/intensity of the ROI masks (0-1).\n- **Minor issues:** \n  - The colorbar actually shows values from 0 to approximately 175, despite the notebook text suggesting the scale should be 0-1. This indicates the weights were not normalized as described.\n  - The aspect ratio appears to be set to 'auto' rather than preserving the true physical proportions.\n- **Major issues:** None. The image clearly shows the ROIs and their spatial arrangement, which is the intended purpose.\n\nAll three figures provide valid visualizations of the data and successfully demonstrate the ability to access and analyze data from the Dandiset. The minor colorbar issue in Figure 3 doesn't affect the overall interpretation of the ROI locations.",
