Overall, both notebooks are of high quality and accomplish the task of introducing the Dandiset. Notebook 1 is more comprehensive in its explanations and future directions, while Notebook 2 includes a more scientifically meaningful correlation analysis. However, I believe Notebook 1's more comprehensive explanations, better error handling, and more detailed coverage of the dataset structure would be more valuable for users who are just getting started with the Dandiset, particularly those who might be less familiar with NWB files or neurophysiology data in general. Therefore, I will select Notebook 1 as the better notebook overall.
