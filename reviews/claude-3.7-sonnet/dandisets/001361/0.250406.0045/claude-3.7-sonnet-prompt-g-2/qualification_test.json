The imaging session spans approximately 320 seconds and shows about 15 completed trials. No major issues are present in this visualization.\n\n## Figure 2: Position Distribution Histogram\nThis histogram shows the distribution of the animal's positions during the recorded session. The x-axis shows position in cm and the y-axis shows count. The distribution has:\n- A large peak near 0 cm (approximately 1400 counts)\n- A smaller peak around 100 cm (approximately 700 counts)\n- A small peak at approximately -500 cm\n- Generally more uniform distribution at positive positions\n\nThis pattern suggests the animal spends more time at certain locations, likely the start position and near reward locations. The visualization is clear with no major issues.\n\n## Figure 3: Speed Distribution Histogram\nThis histogram shows the distribution of the animal's speeds during the recorded session. The x-axis shows speed in cm/s and the y-axis shows count. The distribution is bimodal with:\n- A peak at 0 cm/s (approximately 325 counts) representing stationary periods\n- A larger peak around 65 cm/s (approximately 375 counts) representing the preferred running speed\n- Various intermediate speeds between these two peaks\n\nThis effectively shows the animal's movement patterns, alternating between stationary periods and consistent running speeds. No major issues are present.\n\n## Figure 4: Mean and Max Projection Images\nThis figure shows two grayscale images side by side:\n- Left: Mean image (enhanced contrast) showing the average fluorescence across the recording\n- Right: Max projection (enhanced contrast) showing the maximum fluorescence values across the recording\n\nBoth images show a cluster of bright cells in the center of the field of view, which represents the CA1 pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampus. The images have appropriate colorbars and clear titles. The enhancement of contrast makes the cellular structures visible, though the resolution is somewhat limited. No major issues are present.\n\n## Figure 5: Cell Distribution in CA1\nThis image shows the max projection of the imaging field with text annotations:\n- \"Location: hippocampus, CA1\"\n- \"Indicator: GCaMP7f\"\n\nThe image shows the bright region of the CA1 pyramidal cell layer where calcium imaging was performed. The annotation at the bottom explains that this represents the imaging field of the CA1 pyramidal cell layer. Unlike what the title suggests (\"Cell Distribution\"), no individual ROIs or cell markers are plotted on this image, which is a minor issue. The image otherwise provides a good visualization of the imaging field.\n\n## Figure 6: Fluorescence Traces for Sample Neurons\nThis figure shows calcium activity traces for multiple neurons over time (approximately 125 seconds). Each colored line represents a different neuron's activity, with traces vertically offset for clarity. The traces show:\n- Typical calcium transients (brief increases in fluorescence)\n- Periods of reduced activity that appear synchronized across neurons\n- Characteristic patterns of baseline fluorescence and transient events\n\nThe synchronized drops in activity across neurons correspond to trial transitions. The visualization effectively shows the diversity of neural activity patterns across the sampled cells. No major issues are present.\n\n## Figure 7: Fluorescence Heatmap\nThis heatmap visualizes the activity of 10 neurons (y-axis) over time (x-axis, approximately 2000 frames). Brighter colors (yellow/green) indicate higher fluorescence values. Key features include:\n- Vertical dark bands representing synchronized reductions in activity across neurons, likely during trial transitions\n- Bright spots representing calcium transients in individual neurons\n- Different neurons showing distinct activity patterns\n\nThe heatmap provides an effective overview of population activity. The colorbar properly indicates the fluorescence values. No major issues are present.\n\n## Figure 8: Neural Activity, Position, and Speed vs Time\nThis figure shows three vertically stacked plots sharing the same x-axis (Time in seconds):\n- Top: Blue line showing fluorescence of Neuron 101 over time\n- Middle: Green line showing position (in cm) over time\n- Bottom: Red line showing speed (in cm/s) over time\n\nThe figure effectively illustrates the relationship between neural activity and behavioral variables, showing how the neuron's activity drops during teleportation events and when the animal is stationary between trials. The plots span approximately 125 seconds and show multiple completed trials. No major issues are present.\n\n## Figure 9: Neural Activity vs Position and Speed\nThis figure shows two scatter plots side by side:\n- Left: Fluorescence of Neuron 101 (y-axis) vs Position in cm (x-axis)\n- Right: Fluorescence of Neuron 101 (y-axis) vs Speed in cm/s (x-axis)\n\nThe scatter plots reveal:\n- A bimodal distribution of fluorescence values\n- Lower fluorescence values clustered at certain positions and low speeds\n- Higher fluorescence values across most positions when the animal is moving\n\nThese plots help visualize the non-linear relationship between neural activity and behavioral variables. No major issues are present.\n\n## Figure 10: Place Fields for Top 6 Neurons\nThis figure shows six plots arranged in a 2\u00d73 grid, each displaying the place field (spatial tuning curve) of a different neuron. The x-axis shows position (cm) and the y-axis shows mean fluorescence. The neurons shown are 101, 40, 38, 73, 157, and 219. Each neuron shows:\n- Zero activity in the negative position range (approximately -400 to 0 cm)\n- Elevated activity in the positive position range with various patterns\n- Some neurons showing higher activity around 200 cm\n\nThe plots effectively demonstrate the spatial selectivity of hippocampal neurons. A minor issue is that some of the place fields look very similar, which might suggest either strong functional correlations between neurons or possibly an issue with the binning/calculation method. Otherwise, the visualization is clear.\n\n## Figure 11: Neural Activity Correlation with Position around Reward Zones\nThis bar chart shows the correlation between each neuron's activity and position specifically around reward zones. The x-axis shows neuron IDs and the y-axis shows correlation values. The correlations range from approximately +0.025 to -0.10, with:\n- Most neurons showing negative correlations (activity decreases as position increases near rewards)\n- Two neurons (101 and 83) showing positive correlations\n- Neuron 244 showing the strongest negative correlation\n\nThis visualization effectively shows how different neurons might encode position information relative to rewards. No major issues are present in this figure.",
