    "image_descriptions": "# Description of Images in the Notebook\n\n## Figure 1: \"Position over Time\"\n\n**Overview:**\nThis figure shows the position of the mouse in a virtual linear track over time. The y-axis represents position in centimeters, and the x-axis shows time in seconds. The plot reveals a sawtooth pattern, indicating that the mouse is repeatedly traversing the virtual linear track, moving from one end to the other and then resetting.\n\n**Minor Issues:**\n- None noted; the axes are properly labeled, and the title clearly describes what is being shown.\n\n**Major Issues:**\n- None. The data appears to be valid and shows the expected pattern of movement in a virtual linear track where the animal traverses the environment repeatedly.\n\n## Figure 2: \"Lick over Time\"\n\n**Overview:**\nThis figure displays the licking behavior of the mouse throughout the experiment. The y-axis shows lick intensity in arbitrary units (AU), while the x-axis represents time in seconds. The data appears as vertical lines of varying heights, indicating discrete licking events.\n\n**Minor Issues:**\n- The visualization might benefit from a different plot type (such as a raster or stem plot) that better represents discrete events, since licking is typically a binary event.\n\n**Major Issues:**\n- None. The data appears to be valid and shows clear licking patterns that correspond to specific times during the experiment.\n\n## Figure 3: \"Fluorescence over Time (First 5 ROIs)\"\n\n**Overview:**\nThis figure shows the fluorescence intensity over time for the first 5 Regions of Interest (ROIs), each representing a different neuron in the hippocampus. The y-axis shows fluorescence in lumens, and the x-axis represents time in seconds. Different colored lines represent different ROIs (neurons).\n\n**Minor Issues:**\n- The y-axis scale is dominated by a large spike in ROI 1 (orange line) around 650 seconds, which compresses the visualization of activity in other ROIs. A log scale or multiple subplots might provide better visualization.\n\n**Major Issues:**\n- None. The data shows typical calcium imaging fluorescence patterns with a baseline level and occasional activity spikes, particularly a notable spike in ROI 1 at approximately 650 seconds.\n\nOverall, all three figures successfully visualize the key data types in this dataset: the animal's position in the virtual environment, its licking behavior, and the neural activity recorded from hippocampal neurons. The data appears to be valid and consistent with what would be expected in this type of experiment.",
