   - Notebook 2: Includes code for connecting to DANDI API and retrieving metadata ✓
   Both provide appropriate instructions.

7. **NWB file loading and metadata**:
   - Notebook 1: Loads an NWB file and displays metadata ✓
   - Notebook 2: Loads an NWB file and displays metadata ✓
   Both accomplish this well.

8. **NWB file data description**:
   - Notebook 1: Provides a very detailed description of available data with hierarchy and descriptions ✓
   - Notebook 2: Provides a basic outline of the data structure ✓
   Notebook 1 provides a much more comprehensive data description.

9. **Data loading and visualization**:
   - Notebook 1: Includes multiple visualizations (position, lick events, fluorescence traces, ROI masks) with explanations ✓
   - Notebook 2: Includes visualizations for position, speed, reward, and ROI responses ✓
   Both provide good visualizations, though Notebook 1 includes more variety.

10. **Advanced visualization**:
    - Notebook 1: Includes a scatter plot of speed vs. position ✓
    - Notebook 2: Shows full-session data with reward event markers ✓
    Both include advanced visualizations.

11. **Summary, findings, and future directions**:
    - Notebook 1: Provides detailed summary of findings and extensive future directions ✓
    - Notebook 2: Provides a brief summary and some future directions ✓
    Notebook 1's section is more comprehensive.

12. **Explanatory markdown cells**:
    - Notebook 1: Extensive explanatory markdown cells throughout ✓
    - Notebook 2: Good use of markdown cells, though less detailed than Notebook 1 ✓
    Both use markdown well, but Notebook 1 provides more guidance.

## Quality Assessment

13. **Code documentation**:
    - Notebook 1: Well-documented code with explanatory comments ✓
    - Notebook 2: Documented code but fewer explanatory comments ✓
    Notebook 1 has better code documentation.

14. **Visualization clarity**:
    - Notebook 1: Clean visualizations with appropriate subsampling to manage loading times ✓
    - Notebook 2: Good visualizations, but some plots might be more cluttered with all data points ✓
    Both have clear visualizations, but Notebook 1's approach to managing data size is better.

15. **Focus on getting started**:
    - Notebook 1: Good focus on basics with progressive complexity ✓
    - Notebook 2: Good focus on basics, slightly more concise ✓
    Both maintain appropriate focus.

16. **Structure of NWB file explanation**:
    - Notebook 1: Very detailed explanation of NWB structure ✓
    - Notebook 2: Basic explanation of NWB structure ✓
    Notebook 1 provides much more detail about the NWB structure.

## Overall Evaluation

Notebook 1 is more comprehensive, with:
- More detailed explanations of the data structure
- More varied visualizations
- Better code documentation
- More extensive future directions
- Better management of large datasets (subsampling)
- A Neurosift link that is more clearly presented

Notebook 2 is more concise, with:
- More straightforward code examples
- Full-session visualization that includes reward events
- Still covers the essential elements

Both notebooks accomplish the main goal of helping users get started with the Dandiset, but Notebook 1 provides more depth and guidance throughout the process, making it more suitable for users who are less familiar with NWB files or need more detailed instructions.

Based on the comprehensive evaluation criteria provided, Notebook 1 is the better notebook for helping users understand and explore this Dandiset.
