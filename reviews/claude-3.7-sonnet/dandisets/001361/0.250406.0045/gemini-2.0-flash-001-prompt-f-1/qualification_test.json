    "image_descriptions": "I'll provide a detailed description of each figure in the notebook:\n\n### Figure 1: Position vs. Time\n**Overview:**\nThe figure shows the position of the mouse in a virtual environment over time. The y-axis represents position in centimeters, and the x-axis shows time in seconds. The plot reveals a repetitive pattern where the mouse runs back and forth along a track, with positions ranging from approximately -400 cm to +450 cm. The pattern consists of regular traversals across the track over the course of about 1400 seconds (23+ minutes) of recording.\n\n**Minor issues:**\n- None apparent; the axes are properly labeled, the title is descriptive, and the visualization is clear.\n\n**Major issues:**\n- None; the data appears valid and consistent with what would be expected from a virtual reality navigation experiment.\n\n### Figure 2: Position and Reward vs. Time\n**Overview:**\nThis figure overlays reward delivery times (vertical red lines) on top of the position data (blue line). It shows when rewards were delivered relative to the mouse's position in the virtual environment. The rewards appear to be delivered consistently at specific positions during the traversals, suggesting the experiment had designated reward locations on the track.\n\n**Minor issues:**\n- None; the visualization includes a proper legend, descriptive title, and clear axis labels.\n\n**Major issues:**\n- None; the data appears valid and shows a logical relationship between position and reward delivery.\n\n### Figure 3: Distribution of iscell values\n**Overview:**\nThis histogram shows the distribution of \"iscell\" values, which indicate whether regions of interest (ROIs) are classified as cells or non-cells. The distribution is bimodal with two distinct peaks - one at 0.0 (non-cells) and another at 1.0 (cells). There are approximately 195 ROIs classified as non-cells and about 155 ROIs classified as cells.\n\n**Minor issues:**\n- None; the histogram is well-formatted with proper axis labels and title.\n\n**Major issues:**\n- None; the binary distribution is expected for a cell classification variable and indicates clear separation between what the algorithm considers cells versus non-cells.\n\n### Figure 4: Mean Fluorescence for Cells vs. Non-cells\n**Overview:**\nThis figure compares the mean fluorescence intensity over time between regions classified as cells (blue) and non-cells (orange). The plot shows approximately 20,000 frames of data, with cells consistently showing higher mean fluorescence values (around 1900-2000 lumens) compared to non-cells (fluctuating between about 700-1800 lumens). The non-cell trace shows regular sharp downward deflections, possibly related to the animal's movement or scanning artifacts.\n\n**Minor issues:**\n- None; the plot has proper labeling, a legend distinguishing the two traces, and appropriate scaling.\n\n**Major issues:**\n- None; the difference between cell and non-cell fluorescence is clear and consistent with what would be expected biologically (cells expressing the calcium indicator should show higher and more dynamic fluorescence than non-cells).\n\nOverall, the figures effectively visualize different aspects of the dataset and appear to show biologically plausible patterns typical of hippocampal recordings during navigation tasks.",
