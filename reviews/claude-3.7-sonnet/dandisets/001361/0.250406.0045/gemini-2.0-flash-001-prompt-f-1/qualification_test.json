The y-axis represents position in centimeters, ranging from approximately -400 to 400 cm, while the x-axis shows time from 0 to around 1400 seconds. The trace shows a consistent pattern of back-and-forth movement across the track, appearing as regular oscillations between position extremes.\n\n**Minor issues:** None significant; the figure is well-formatted with clear axes labels and title.\n\n**Major issues:** None. The data appears complete and interpretable, showing clear repetitive movement patterns typical of a mouse running back and forth on a linear track.\n\n## Figure 2: \"Position and Reward vs. Time\"\n**Overview:** This figure overlays reward events (red vertical lines) on top of the position data (blue trace) over time. The plot shows the temporal relationship between the mouse's position and when rewards were delivered. The reward events appear as vertical red lines spanning the full y-axis range.\n\n**Minor issues:** None; the figure includes a proper legend, clear axes labels, and a descriptive title.\n\n**Major issues:** None. The visualization effectively shows that rewards are typically delivered at specific positions, though with some variability, which is consistent with the experimental design for spatial navigation tasks.\n\n## Figure 3: \"Distribution of iscell values\"\n**Overview:** This histogram displays the distribution of \"iscell\" values, which categorize regions of interest (ROIs) as either cells (value of 1) or non-cells (value of 0). The bimodal distribution shows approximately 195 ROIs classified as non-cells and about 155 ROIs classified as cells.\n\n**Minor issues:** None; the axes are properly labeled, and the title is descriptive.\n\n**Major issues:** None. The binary distribution (values only at 0 or 1) clearly shows how the ROIs have been classified into two distinct groups with no ambiguous cases between, which is consistent with the cell segmentation algorithm's output.\n\n## Figure 4: \"Mean Fluorescence for Cells vs. Non-cells\"\n**Overview:** This figure compares the mean fluorescence activity over time between regions identified as cells (blue) and non-cells (orange). The x-axis represents time in frames (approximately 20,000 frames), and the y-axis shows mean fluorescence intensity in arbitrary units (labeled as \"lumens\" though this is likely not the correct physical unit for fluorescence intensity).\n\n**Minor issues:** \n- The y-axis label uses \"lumens\" as the unit, which isn't typically used for fluorescence intensity measurements (photons, arbitrary units, or \u0394F/F would be more conventional).\n- The timescale is in frames rather than seconds, which makes it harder to relate to the behavioral data shown in previous figures.\n\n**Major issues:** None. The visualization effectively shows that regions classified as cells generally have higher mean fluorescence than non-cells, which is consistent with expectations for calcium imaging data where active neurons should show higher fluorescence levels than background regions.\n\nAll figures are well-constructed and effectively illustrate the data being analyzed in the notebook, providing good visualizations of the key aspects of this Dandiset examining hippocampal activity during virtual navigation.",
