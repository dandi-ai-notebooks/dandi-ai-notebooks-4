Let me compare both notebooks based on the provided criteria:

1. **Title including Dandiset name**: Both notebooks have the same title "Exploring Dandiset 001361: A flexible hippocampal population code for experience relative to reward". So they're equal on this point.

2. **AI-generated disclaimer**: Both notebooks include a disclaimer that they are AI-generated and not fully verified. Notebook 2 makes this more prominent by using bold formatting.

3. **Dandiset overview**: Both notebooks provide a basic overview of the Dandiset, including a link to the DANDI archive. Notebook 2 provides slightly more context by mentioning that this is related to a publication in Nature Neuroscience.

4. **Summary of notebook contents**: Both notebooks include this, but Notebook 2 has a more clearly structured section titled "What this notebook will cover."

5. **Required packages**: Both notebooks list the required packages. Notebook 2 includes seaborn which is used later for visualizations.

6. **Loading Dandiset via API**: Both notebooks demonstrate this step adequately.

7. **Loading NWB files and metadata**: Both notebooks show how to load an NWB file and display metadata. Notebook 2 explores the metadata more extensively.

8. **Description of data in NWB file**: Notebook 2 provides a much more comprehensive exploration of the available data, with detailed sections for different data types (acquisition, behavior, ophys, devices, imaging planes, subject).

9. **Loading and visualizing data**: Both notebooks show how to plot position data and fluorescence data. Notebook 2's visualizations have better formatting (using seaborn) and include more context through proper titles and labels.

10. **Advanced visualizations**: Neither notebook has particularly advanced visualizations combining multiple data types, but both show basic time series plots.

11. **Summary and future directions**: Both notebooks include this section. The content is similar, though Notebook 2 formats this more clearly with bullet points.

12. **Explanatory markdown cells**: Both notebooks use markdown cells to guide the analysis, but Notebook 2 has more extensive and clearer explanations.

13. **Code documentation**: Notebook 2 includes more inline comments and explanations of what the code is doing.

14. **Focus on basics**: Both notebooks focus on the basics of getting started with the Dandiset without overinterpretation.

15. **Clear visualizations**: Both notebooks have clear visualizations, but Notebook 2's visualizations have better formatting with seaborn, clearer titles, and proper axes labels.

Additional observations:
- Notebook 2 more extensively explores the NWB file's structure with dedicated sections for different components (acquisition, behavior, ophys, etc.), making it easier to understand what data are available.
- Notebook 2's code is better documented with print statements that show both the attribute being accessed and its value.
- Notebook 2's visualizations are more polished with better styling and more complete labeling.
- Notebook 2 includes a link to explore the NWB file in neurosift at a more prominent position.
- Notebook 2 explores more aspects of the NWB file metadata.

While both notebooks cover the essential aspects of exploring the Dandiset, Notebook 2 provides more comprehensive exploration of the NWB file structure, has better documentation, and produces more polished visualizations. It would be more helpful for users trying to understand what data are available in the Dandiset and how to access them.

Therefore, based on all these criteria, Notebook 2 is better.
