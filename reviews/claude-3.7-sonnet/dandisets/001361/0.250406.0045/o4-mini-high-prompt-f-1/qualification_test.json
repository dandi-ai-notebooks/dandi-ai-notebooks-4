    "image_descriptions": "# Description of the Figure in the Notebook\n\nThe notebook contains one figure with two subplots showing behavioral data from the NWB file:\n\n## Overview of the Figure\n\nThe figure consists of two time series plots stacked vertically:\n\n**Top subplot - Speed over time (first 2000 samples):**\n- Shows animal speed (y-axis, in cm/s) plotted against time (x-axis, in seconds)\n- The data reveals a cyclic pattern of motion with periods of high speed (60-70 cm/s) alternating with periods where the speed drops to zero\n- The animal appears to be moving in a structured pattern with consistent velocity profiles\n\n**Bottom subplot - Position over time (first 2000 samples):**\n- Shows animal position (y-axis, in cm) plotted against time (x-axis, in seconds)\n- The position data shows a sawtooth pattern with gradual increases (from approximately -50cm to +400cm) followed by abrupt drops back to the starting position\n- These patterns align with the speed data, suggesting the animal is traversing a linear track and being teleported back to the start position after reaching the end\n\n## Minor Issues with the Figure\n\nThere are no obvious minor issues with the figure. The formatting is appropriate with:\n- Clear titles for each subplot\n- Properly labeled x and y axes (including units)\n- Good use of color differentiation between the two plots\n- Appropriate sizing and layout\n\n## Major Issues with the Figure\n\nThere are no major issues with the figure. The data appears to be:\n- Properly loaded and displayed\n- Consistent with expected behavioral patterns for a virtual linear track experiment\n- Showing meaningful variations in both speed and position\n- Capturing the experimental design features (teleportation is evident from the position plot)\n\nThe figure effectively visualizes the movement patterns of the subject during the experiment and would be useful for understanding the behavioral context in which the neural data was recorded.",
