    "image_descriptions": "The notebook contains one figure with two subplots showing behavioral data from the Dandiset:\n\n### Figure Description:\n\nThe figure shows two time series plots stacked vertically, displaying behavioral data for the first 2000 samples:\n\n1. **Top subplot - Speed over time**:\n   - Shows animal speed (y-axis, in cm/s) plotted against time (x-axis, in seconds)\n   - The data reveals a cyclical pattern with speeds ranging from 0 to approximately 75 cm/s\n   - The animal's movement appears to involve periods of acceleration, constant speed, and then stopping (speed drops to zero)\n   - Several complete movement cycles are visible over the ~120-second period shown\n\n2. **Bottom subplot - Position over time**:\n   - Shows the animal's position (y-axis, in cm) over the same time period (x-axis, in seconds)\n   - The position data shows clear sawtooth-like patterns with abrupt resets\n   - Position values range from approximately -500 cm to 450 cm\n   - The pattern suggests the animal is moving along a linear track and being \"teleported\" back to the start position when reaching the end\n\n### Minor Issues:\n- No significant formatting issues - the plots have appropriate titles, axis labels, and units\n- The figure is well-constructed with good use of different colors to distinguish the two metrics\n- The layout is clean with appropriate spacing between subplots\n\n### Major Issues:\n- No major issues with the figure\n- The data appears to be valid and clearly represents animal movement patterns\n- The visualization effectively shows the relationship between speed and position in this experimental paradigm\n\nThe figure successfully illustrates the cyclic nature of the experiment, where the animal appears to be repeatedly traversing a linear track with occasional teleports back to the starting position, which is consistent with the kinds of tasks often used in hippocampal research.",
