    "image_descriptions": "I'll provide detailed descriptions of each of the three figures in the notebook:\n\n### Figure 1: Position over Time with Reward Events\n\n**Overview:**\nThis figure shows the animal's position (in cm) over time (in seconds) during the experimental session, with reward events marked as red triangles at the top of the plot. The position trace shows a clear pattern of the animal moving back and forth between approximately -50 cm and 400 cm, creating a sawtooth pattern that represents the animal traversing a linear track or virtual corridor repeatedly. Reward events (red triangles) appear to be consistently delivered at specific positions, likely when the animal reaches a goal location.\n\n**Minor issues:**\n- The y-axis range extends from -400 to 400 cm, but the data mostly occupies the range between -50 and 400 cm, which means there's some unused space in the plot.\n- The initial data point shows a very low position value (around -500 cm) which appears to be an outlier.\n\n**Major issues:**\n- None significant. The figure clearly conveys the experimental design of an animal traversing a virtual track with rewards delivered at specific locations.\n\n### Figure 2: Speed over Time\n\n**Overview:**\nThis figure displays the animal's speed (in cm/s) over the same time period as the position plot. The speed oscillates between 0 and approximately 75 cm/s, with clear periods of acceleration and deceleration. This pattern aligns with the position data, showing the animal repeatedly accelerating, reaching maximum speeds around 60-70 cm/s, then decelerating to rest, likely at the endpoints of the track.\n\n**Minor issues:**\n- No legend is included, though it's not strictly necessary since only one data series is plotted.\n\n**Major issues:**\n- None. The speed data appears consistent with the position data and provides a good visualization of the animal's movement patterns.\n\n### Figure 3: Deconvolved ROI Responses for First 5 ROIs\n\n**Overview:**\nThis figure shows deconvolved calcium signals from the first 5 regions of interest (ROIs), representing neural activity from different neurons in hippocampal area CA1. Each ROI is plotted in a different color, with activity measured in \"Fluorescence (lumens)\" over time. The signals show characteristic sparse activity patterns typical of deconvolved calcium imaging data, with sharp peaks representing inferred neural firing events against a low baseline.\n\n**Minor issues:**\n- The legend is somewhat difficult to read with the alternating color pattern - a single column legend might be more clear.\n- The y-axis label \"Fluorescence (lumens)\" might be misleading, as deconvolved signals are typically unitless representations of inferred neural activity rather than direct measurements of light.\n\n**Major issues:**\n- ROI 1 (orange) shows an exceptionally large peak around 600 seconds that goes to ~11,000 units, while most other activity is below 5,000. This could be a physiological response, but the extreme magnitude might warrant investigation to ensure it's not an artifact.\n- Without spatial information about these ROIs, it's difficult to interpret their activity in relation to the animal's behavior (though this is a limitation of the visualization, not necessarily an error).\n\nAll three figures effectively convey the key aspects of the dataset, showing both behavioral metrics and neural activity patterns that would be suitable for further analysis of how hippocampal neurons encode spatial information in relation to reward locations.",
