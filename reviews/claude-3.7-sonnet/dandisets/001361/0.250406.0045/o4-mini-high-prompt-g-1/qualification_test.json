    "image_descriptions": "# Description of Images in the Notebook\n\n## Figure 1: \"Position over Time with Reward Events\"\n\n**Overview:**\nThis figure shows the animal's position (in cm) over time (in seconds) during a virtual navigation task. The blue line represents the position, while the red triangles at the top of the figure mark reward delivery events.\n\n**Key observations:**\n- The position data shows a sawtooth pattern, indicating repeated traversals of a linear track or corridor from approximately -50 to 400 cm\n- There are consistent reward events (red triangles) that appear to occur at the maximum position, suggesting rewards were delivered at one end of the track\n- The session lasted approximately 1400 seconds (about 23 minutes)\n- The animal completed numerous traversals (about 70-80 laps) during the recording session\n\n**Minor issues:**\n- None significant; the figure is clearly labeled with appropriate axes and legend\n\n**Major issues:**\n- None identified; the data appears to be properly visualized and interpretable\n\n## Figure 2: \"Speed over Time\"\n\n**Overview:**\nThis figure displays the animal's speed (in cm/s) over the same time period as the position data in the first figure.\n\n**Key observations:**\n- Speed values range from 0 to approximately 75 cm/s\n- There's a rhythmic pattern of acceleration and deceleration corresponding to the animal's movement along the track\n- Speed drops to zero at regular intervals, likely when the animal stops or turns around\n- There appears to be a slight change in the pattern between 600-800 seconds, with somewhat lower peak speeds in this interval\n\n**Minor issues:**\n- None significant; the figure is appropriately labeled\n\n**Major issues:**\n- None identified; the data visualization is clear and aligns with expected speed patterns for track navigation\n\n## Figure 3: \"Deconvolved ROI Responses for First 5 ROIs\"\n\n**Overview:**\nThis figure shows deconvolved calcium fluorescence signals from 5 different regions of interest (ROIs), which likely represent individual neurons or small groups of neurons in hippocampal area CA1.\n\n**Key observations:**\n- Five different ROIs are plotted with different colors\n- The y-axis shows fluorescence intensity (in lumens)\n- Most ROIs show sparse activity patterns with occasional sharp increases in signal\n- ROI 1 (orange) appears to be the most active\n- There's a particularly large spike in ROI 1 at approximately 600 seconds\n- The signals are consistent with deconvolved calcium imaging data, showing discrete events rather than slow calcium transients\n\n**Minor issues:**\n- The legend is partially hard to read due to overlapping labels (ROIs 0 and 3 appear in one column, ROIs 1, 2, and 4 in another)\n\n**Major issues:**\n- None identified; the deconvolved calcium data appears to be properly visualized and shows biologically plausible neuronal activity patterns\n\nAll figures effectively support the notebook's goal of introducing the dataset and demonstrating basic visualization of both behavioral and neural data from this hippocampal recording during a virtual navigation task.",
